168
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,030
A. It's an hour long.

169
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,333
B. Ms.

170
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:16,856
Pavlova isn't retiring for several weeks.

171
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:21,042
C. No, that department's upstairs.

172
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,827
Number 26.

173
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,833
Should I deliver these pizzas, or will you?

174
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:34,517
A. No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

175
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:35,739
B.

176
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,662
$10 for two.

177
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,906
C. They're being picked up.

178
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:47,315
Number 27.

179
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:51,020
This month's shipment schedule has been revised.

180
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,524
A. I couldn't find them either.

181
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:55,826
B.

182
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:57,780
Which dates have been changed?

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,943
$2 per pound.

184
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:06,930
Number 28.

185
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,873
How much will the repairs cost?

186
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,838
A. The work is covered under the warranty plan.

187
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,003
B. Yes, it's also available in red.

188
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,946
C. In about two weeks.

189
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:27,355
Number 29.

190
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:31,140
Why don't we provide more samples of the wallpaper patterns?

191
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:34,924
A. The newspaper is delivered daily.

192
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:39,630
B. An interior design course.

193
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,013
C. There are plenty in the binders.

194
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,180
Number 30.

195
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,204
Can you give me a tour of the property this afternoon?

196
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,586
A.

197
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:56,441
Sorry, I won't have time until tomorrow.

198
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:00,085
B. It has a very modern design.

199
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:08,476
C. A house on Maple Street.

200
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,217
Number 31.

201
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,641
Who's scheduled to test the product today?

202
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:16,086
A. We're waiting for confirmation.

203
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,430
B. It's a great album, right?

204
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,834
C. About six weeks ago.

205
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:28,635
Part 3.

206
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,157
Directions.

207
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,763
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

208
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:41,272
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

209
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:50,585
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

210
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:57,074
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

211
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:02,586
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

212
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:04,708
Good morning, Captain.

213
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,971
We'll be docking at the port in Kolkata this evening, right?

214
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:13,957
Actually, we had to change course overnight to avoid a storm, so we're running behind schedule.

215
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,239
But we should arrive early tomorrow.

216
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,121
Well, that's not too bad.

217
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:25,848
Oh, Hector has the day off today, so I'll need you to do the morning rounds, starting with checking the machinery in the engine room.

218
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,050
Of course, I'll head there now.

219
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,219
Number 32.

220
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,244
Where does the conversation most likely take place?

221
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,176
Number 33.

222
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:46,839
What caused a delay?

223
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:56,271
Number 34.

224
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,994
What will the man do next?

225
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:11,549
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

226
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,016
Hi, I'm here to schedule some personal training sessions.

227
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,479
Okay, what are your fitness goals?

228
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,444
I'd like to lift weights and build strength.

229
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,186
I can work with you on that.

230
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,049
Are you currently a member here?

231
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,835
No, I'll also need to sign up for a membership.

232
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:34,644
I saw online that you're running a special for new members, 50% off the first month's membership.

233
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,146
Can I sign up for that?

234
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,139
Absolutely.

235
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,206
But before I get you signed up, let me show you around our facility.

236
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,672
Number 35.

237
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,797
Where does the woman most likely work?

238
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,193
Number 36.

239
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,018
What does the man ask about?

240
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,256
Number 37.

241
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,819
What will the woman do next?

242
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,876
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

243
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:30,245
As you can see, this Renaissance landscape painting we acquired is in bad condition.

244
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,007
We can't display it yet.

245
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:33,850
Hmm, yes.

246
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,074
This painting will need significant restoration work.

247
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:44,252
I'll begin by investigating the artist's color palette and style to see how we should repair the damaged areas.

248
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:49,641
You know, this would be a stunning piece to unveil at our anniversary dinner in June.

249
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:54,708
And since it's a big project to finish by then, we should get started right away.

250
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:57,693
Number 38.

251
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:00,978
Who most likely are the speakers?

252
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:09,787
Number 39.

253
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,093
What does the woman say she will do?

254
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:22,190
Number 40.

255
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,578
Why does the man suggest beginning a project quickly?

256
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:40,254
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

257
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:42,197
Hi, Ozan.

258
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:46,163
Do you have time to review some slides I'm presenting at a meeting on Thursday?

259
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:49,668
Oh, is that the meeting with Smith Incorporated?

260
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:54,655
Yes, I'm presenting them with our updated marketing plan for their chain of bookstores.

261
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:59,122
You know, Smith Incorporated prefers informal meetings.

262
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:06,125
I think just a handout highlighting how our marketing plan will positively impact their book sales would be enough.

263
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:06,485
Really?

264
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:09,490
Thilo, you've worked with this client before.

265
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,211
What do you think?

266
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:11,573
OZON is right.

267
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:16,001
I think they'd prefer a meeting that was more of a conversation than a presentation.

268
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:18,845
Number 41.

269
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:21,810
What is the woman preparing?

270
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,619
Number 42.

271
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,585
What kind of business is Smith Incorporated?

272
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:43,519
Number 43.

273
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,403
What do the men agree about?

274
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,178
Go on to the next page.

275
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:05,712
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

276
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,759
I heard that the results of your experiment were better than you expected.

277
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,321
Congratulations.

278
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:12,962
Thanks.

279
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:19,751
I thought we'd have to run that reaction ten times before we got a positive result, but we got it on the third try.

280
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,257
You'll have to write up your results and submit them to the research director.

281
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:25,799
That's Ezra, right?

282
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,883
Oh, Ezra's leaving the company next week.

283
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,026
Oh, I didn't know that.

284
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,781
I wonder if you'll be promoted to fill her position.

285
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,283
I don't think so.

286
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,787
I've never managed an entire research group.

287
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,530
I hope to get some experience doing that next quarter.

288
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:44,774
Number 44.

289
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,078
Why does the woman congratulate the man?

290
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:57,570
Number 45.

291
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:01,074
What does the man imply when he says...

292
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,745
Ezra's leaving the company next week.

293
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:12,700
Number 46.

294
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,566
What does the man hope to do next quarter?

295
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,426
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

296
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:37,321
Now we'll move on to a special segment of our news program where we highlight new local businesses for our viewers.

297
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:42,666
Today I'm talking with Drove Bahaj, a personal trainer and gym owner.

298
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,389
Thanks for coming into the studio today, Drove.

299
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,031
Thanks for having me.

300
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,835
I'm excited to tell you about the gym I just opened last month.

301
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:56,881
It has state-of-the-art equipment, and my trainers can work with clients at any stage in their fitness journey.

302
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,162
Sounds great.

303
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,429
How did you get started in this line of work?

304
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:08,117
Well, I was an athlete in school, and when I stopped competing, I wanted to continue doing something fitness-related.

305
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,300
So I started working as a trainer.

306
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,564
Number 47.

307
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,527
Where most likely are the speakers?

308
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:25,938
Number 48.

309
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,960
What does the man say he recently did?

310
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,929
Number 49.

311
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,893
What does the woman ask the man to talk about?

312
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:55,666
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

313
00:21:56,642 --> 00:22:01,068
As director, I'm delighted to welcome you to the Redmond Aquatic Institute.

314
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:04,753
We're happy you'll be producing content for our website.

315
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:09,239
I'm looking forward to writing about Redmond's initiatives in marine biology.

316
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:14,526
Yes, the more articles the public can read about threats to aquatic ecosystems, the better.

317
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:19,933
Public awareness will help us get funding to meet our aim of preserving these ecosystems.

318
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:21,535
This is Roberto.

319
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:26,642
He's working on our Mangrove Research Project, which is the first one you'll cover.

320
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,271
It's an interesting project.

321
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:33,576
And what's exciting is that we've started using drones to photograph the area with the mangroves.

322
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,239
So we have some great images you could use.

323
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,262
Number 50.

324
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:42,245
What has the woman been hired to do?

325
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:51,293
Number 51.

326
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:56,018
According to the director, what is the organization's goal?

Matthew, you're not planning to cancel Wednesday's budget meeting, are you?

331
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:33,554
I haven't sent out the cancellation yet, but our research partners in China are off this week for a national holiday.

332
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,127
So there's no point in meeting.

333
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:35,828
Why?

334
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:42,915
Well, I've been looking at the draft budget, and we didn't allocate funds for a project leader.

335
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,978
Uh-oh, I wonder how that happened.

336
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:47,200
You're right.

337
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,602
We need to discuss how to fix that.

338
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:55,348
You know, we allocated money for a trip to Singapore to present our preliminary findings.

339
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,850
We don't really need to do that.

340
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,394
Number 53

341
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:05,366

Number 54.

343
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:21,846

Hello, you've reached tech support.

348
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,306
I'm calling from Ruben Restaurant Equipment.

349
00:24:54,007 --> 00:25:00,192
I recently purchased your software to keep track of my warehouse inventory, and I have a question about setting alerts.

350
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:00,813
Sure.

351
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:01,874
How can I help?

352
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:11,701
Well, we've been getting an alert whenever the inventory for our deep fryers drops below 10, but we usually don't stock many of those because restaurants don't often need to replace them.

353
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,785
So, can I lower the alert level for just those items?

354
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:16,546
Yes.

355
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:24,735
In the system, if you click on that product, you'll see a link that says set custom alert, and you can set it to any number from there.

356
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:25,837
I see it.

357
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:27,078

He wants us to install an irrigation system in the Rose Garden, as well as the Magnolia Grove.

367
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:23,856
He wants to be sure the flowers get plenty of water during the hot summer months.

368
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:24,817
Okay.

369
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:27,320
Let's walk over there now and take some measurements.

370
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,843
Then we can figure out what materials we'll need.

371
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:30,664
Sure.

372
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:35,250
We have some extra parts left over from when we worked on the cherry trees.

373
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,195
I'll check what we have left after we finish measuring the Rose Garden.

Sorry I'm a little late.

384
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,742
Traffic was terrible.

385
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:34,066
That's okay, but our rental office will be very busy this morning.

386
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:42,929
There's a big education convention in town starting today, and a lot of attendees from out of town have reserved cars to get to the conference center.

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:43,950
Right.

388
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:46,053
What do you want me to do first?

389
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:50,598
I'd like you to start by checking the batteries in our electric cars.

390
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,642
We want to be sure they're all fully charged.

There'll be a children's poster competition next month, which the city mayor will judge.

We'll be giving away the tallest of these four varieties, since it was the most popular in a survey of our residents.
