00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,381
We're in complete agreement on that.

168
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,852
Number 25.

169
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,779
How much oil does your heater use in the winter?

170
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:35,768
A. We may need to stop for gas on our trip.

171
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,634
B. That recipe calls for butter.

172
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:44,082
C. We only use electric appliances.

173
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:49,879
Number 26.

174
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,923
Where can I find the vitamins?

A. In aisle 6.

176
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,073
B. That's a really healthy recipe.

177
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:04,059
C. The library is closed on Sundays.

178
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,047
Number 27.

179
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,652
Thank you for helping me create a survey.

180
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:17,778
A. The software did most of the work.

181
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:21,197
B. Our loyal customers.

182
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:25,441

183

Number 28.

184
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:35,490
When will you be done testing the new mobile app?

185
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,055
A. No, just an older laptop model.

186
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:44,339
B. I'm almost finished.

187
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,442
C. It's about a two-hour drive from here.

188
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,724
Number 29.

189
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:57,809
Don't forget to turn off the projector after your presentation.

190
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,314
A. I don't have a summary.

191
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:05,821
B. Should I return it to the supply closet?

192
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:09,786
C. Please distribute these handouts.

193
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:15,935
Number 30.

194
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,700
Didn't there used to be a parking garage on this street?

195
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:21,202
A.

196
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,480
Yes, but it's being torn down.

197
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:28,327
B. You can hang your keys on this hook.

198
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,950
C. My car has a flat tire.

199
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:36,878
Number 31.

200
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,405
Will you be available to work on Thursday or Friday?

201
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:45,670
A. There's mandatory training on Friday.

202
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,696
B. Yes, it was a good show.

203
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:51,218
C.

204
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:52,999
a daily schedule.

205
00:13:58,207 --> 00:13:58,848
Part 3.

206
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:00,350
Directions.

207
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,996
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

208
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:11,465
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

209
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:20,818
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C or D on your answer sheet.

210
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,116
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

211
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:32,782
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

212
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:37,947
Hi, I'm Gabriella Alvarez of Organic Easy Meals.

213
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:44,133
I'm scheduled to offer some samples of our new vegetable chips to your customers from 3 to 5 p.m.

214
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:45,255
Oh, yes.

215
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,015
Hello, Ms.

216
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:46,556
Alvarez.

217
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,658
I'm Ryan Hughes, the manager.

218
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:51,642
We have a table set up for you at the end of aisle 8.

219
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,104
That's our snack aisle.

220
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:54,025
Thanks.

221
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,030
I'll start bringing in food and some equipment from my truck.

222
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,355
But first, I'd like to take a look at the table I'll be using.

223
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:02,617
Sounds good.

224
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:06,141
If you'd like any help bringing in your stuff, just let me know.

225
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:09,065
Number 32.

226
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,530
What is the woman preparing to do?

227
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:21,960
Number 33.

228
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:26,186
Where is the conversation most likely taking place?

229
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,581
Number 34.

230
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,866
What does the man offer to help with?

231
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:51,407
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

232
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:53,049
Hello.

233
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,034
I received a notice in the mail about a fee I need to pay because I returned some books late.

234
00:15:58,454 --> 00:15:59,596
My name is Ling Gow.

235
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:01,217
Hmm.

236
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:01,598
Yes.

237
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,002
It says here in the system that you owe $10 for overdue materials.

238
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:07,905
Would you like to pay that now?

239
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,606
Do you take credit cards?

240
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:14,812
We usually accept either cash or credit, but our card reader has been malfunctioning.

241
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:16,754
Let me see if it's working again.

242
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,128
Number 35.

243
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,011
Who most likely is the man?

244
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:32,523
Number 36.

245
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,347
What does the woman ask about?

246
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:44,718
Number 37.

247
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,762
What does the man say he will do?

248
00:16:55,842 --> 00:17:01,048
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

249
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:03,090
Hi, everybody.

250
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,493
Are we ready for the sales meeting this morning?

251
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,797
Yes, I've finished putting together my presentation.

252
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,219
The meeting's in the conference room, right?

253
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,062
No, there's been a last-minute change.

254
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:19,769
The conference room is being used by the IT department all day to interview job candidates.

255
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,269
Oh, no.

256
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,433
My presentation requires the use of a television.

257
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:24,434
Don't worry.

258
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,840
We're meeting in the boardroom.

259
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,423
There's a smart TV there.

260
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:30,187
Is that room large enough for our team?

261
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,190
Yes, we won't have a problem.

262
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:35,135
Number 38.

263
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,001
What does the woman say she has finished doing?

264
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:48,376
Number 39.

265
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:51,922
Why was a change made at the last minute?

266
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:00,803
Number 40.

267
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,608
What is the woman concerned about?

268
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:16,089
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

269
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,856
Did you see the road construction sign at the corner?

270
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:23,001
All traffic is being directed away from our street.

271
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,804
No one can come this way.

272
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,066
I know.

273
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,675
How will customers visit our store to make copies and pick up photo prints?

274
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,358
I'm afraid they'll have to park on another street.

275
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,841
They can still access the store on foot.

276
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:36,703
Okay.

277
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,287
I'll update our social media page to direct our customers.

278
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,210
Number 41.

279
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,795
What problem do the speakers discuss?

280
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:56,146
Number 42.

281
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:59,897
What does the man say customers will have to do?

282
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:08,908
Number 43.

283
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,891
What will the woman do next?

284
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,682
Go on to the next page.

285
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:31,228
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

286
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:39,258
It's your first day working here, so we'll spend the morning surveying the walking trails so you can get a sense of the area.

287
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:44,885
While we're at it, we'll also collect soil samples from different areas of the park.

288
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:49,291
We need to test the soil samples to monitor the health of the preserve, right?

289
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:50,112
Yes.

290
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:55,058
We don't have a laboratory, so we send them out for testing every month.

291
00:19:55,362 --> 00:20:00,911
And since it's a sunny day today, it's a good time to take photographs for our social media page.

292
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,013
I can do that.

293
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,575
I brought my camera.

294
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:06,760
Number 44.

295
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:10,065
Where do the speakers most likely work?

296
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:19,440
Number 45.

297
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:23,026
What will the speakers do with some samples?

298
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:31,783
Number 46.

299
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,469
What does the woman volunteer to do?

300
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:48,249
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

301
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,392
Good morning, Ivan.

302
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:54,599
Everyone's talking about the flyer that was posted on our bulletin board yesterday.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,701
Have you seen it?

304
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,026
I was out of the office yesterday, but I've heard...

305
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,502
Big changes are coming for all mail carriers in the city.

306
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:03,563
That's right.

307
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:07,809
Our entire postal delivery fleet is being replaced with electric vehicles.

308
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,174
I just hope that we don't have to charge them every few hours.

309
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:15,079
I'm concerned that the battery won't last through my entire route.

310
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:17,883
Number 47.

311
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:20,466
Who are the speakers?

312
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,231
Number 48.

313
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,236
What was announced in a flyer?

314
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:41,209
Number 49.

315
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,374
What is the man concerned about?

316
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:58,194
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

317
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:01,301
Dakota, I want you to meet Claudia.

318
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:03,504
Claudia is starting work today.

319
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:07,530
Could you show her around and explain some of our processes?

320
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,172
Of course, Ms.

321
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:09,592
Park.

322
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,615
Welcome to the team, Claudia.

323
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:12,657
Thank you.

324
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:17,163
I'm coming from the Silver Ridge Inn, where I also worked at the front desk.

325
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:22,010
So you already have experience with taking reservations and checking in guests?

326
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,476
Yes, but we used a different software system than the one I see you have here.

327
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:28,178
It's easy to use.

328
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,332
Let me show you how.

Wow, I didn't expect this restaurant to be so popular.

338
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,228
Look at all the people waiting to be seated.

339
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,109
I know.

340
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,511
It's brand new.

341
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,914
I didn't think anyone knew about it yet.

342
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,937
Looks like we won't be able to get a table for a while.

343
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,059
Well, we don't have much time.

344
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,723
We need to drive back to the office to train our interns at 1 o'clock.

345
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:35,485
Should we go somewhere else?

346
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:37,507
Let's see if they offer takeout.

347
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,510
We can just order something to go.

348
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,391
Good idea.

349
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:42,893
I'm looking forward to trying the spicy noodles.

Did you see the email from management?

359
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,930
I just got here to teach my aerobics class.

360
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,535
It looks like the gym is opening another facility just a few miles from here.

361
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:44,460
I'm surprised they want to open another location so close by.

362
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,265
Well, this is a densely populated area.

363
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:49,146
True.

364
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,829
I guess they'll have to hire more employees.

365
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,494
There's just not enough of us to staff both locations.

366

Sure.

375
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:51,528
We could reserve the conference room upstairs.

376
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,994
But the event wouldn't be just for on-site graphic designers.

377
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:58,206
Nearly a third of our staff will be participating remotely.

378
00:25:58,907 --> 00:25:59,688
Oh, you're right.

379
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,592
Everyone needs to feel equally included.

380
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:07,099
Let's have our on-site staff join the event from their desks.

381
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,465
Okay, I'll do a search for effective team-building activities that we can do online.

382
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:14,369
Number 59.

Yes, we do.

393
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:19,365
We're fully stocked at the moment, so you'll be able to see everything that's on our online catalogue.

394
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,648
Okay, one more thing.

395
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:23,250
I use a wheelchair.

396
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,083
and I'm concerned about navigating your store.

397
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,725
Oh, that's not a problem.

398
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,933
We have large elevators that can easily accommodate a wheelchair.

399
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:32,714
Great.

00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:41,403
Our investors want me to present a project update there as soon as possible.

412
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,686
Can you get me on the first flight to Kyoto tomorrow morning?

413
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:45,827
Let me check.

414
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:51,512
Per company policy, we can only use Blue Jet Airlines for international travel.

415
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:55,296
And unfortunately, that flight's not the first one out tomorrow.

416
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:56,797
That will have to do.

417
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,618
Thanks.

418
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,800

Can you arrange that?

420

My sources have confirmed the story, actually.

I've just gained exclusive access to some bidding proposals.

Four cities are competing for the project.

436

It's great you were able to confirm this before we went on the air.

Do you know where the new stadium might be built?

489
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:22,013
Number 78 What event did the speaker recently participate in?

490
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:35,506

Questions 80 through 82 refer to the following telephone message.

492
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:51,385
This is Giovanni calling from Salazar Market.

493
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:55,071
We're excited about selling your breakfast cereal in our store.

494
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:58,896
Our customers have been asking for your brand for several months now.

495
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:01,861
I'll be emailing you a contract later today.

496
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:05,646
You can sign it and send it back to me at your convenience.

497
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,994
It states that we'll be displaying your cereals at the end of an aisle on the end cap as you requested.

498
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:17,795
You'll want to make sure we have enough boxes in the store to create a nice display and keep the shelves well stocked for you.

499
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:20,679
Number 80.

500
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,323
What does the listener produce?

501
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:32,256
Number 81.

502
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:36,402
What does the speakers say he will send the listener?

503
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:45,243
Number 82.

504
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,969
What does the speaker recommend doing?

Go on to the next page.

506
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:08,739
Questions 83 through 85 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

507
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:10,482
Team

508
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,776
Let's debrief on the trial run of the DQY5, our satellite internet system.

509
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:23,424
As you know, the DQY5 is a small satellite dish that can be used to access the internet in remote locations.

510
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:27,128
Test users have said that it generally works very well.

511
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:33,255
However, they all report service interruptions when winter storms cover the satellite dish in snow.

512
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:39,762
That means we need to focus on designing an internal system that can heat up the satellite receiver

513
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:43,451
and melt the snow to ensure that the connection is not disrupted.

514
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:50,561
Let's break into groups of three and start brainstorming technical solutions.

515
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,704
Number 83.

516
00:37:52,724 --> 00:38:03,519
What type of product has the team developed?

517
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:04,641
Number 84.

518
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,466
What has caused a problem for some users?

519
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,171
Number 85.

520
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:21,255
What will the listeners most likely do next?

521
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:33,529
Questions 86 through 88 refer to the following announcement.

522
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,754
Thanks for joining us for this evening's community orchestra performance.

523
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:42,198
The concert was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m.

524
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:46,002
Unfortunately, some of the microphones aren't working.

525
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:53,629
So while our sound engineers are correcting the issue, I'd like to tell you about an opportunity to help the theatre.

526
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:59,495
You may notice that all our ushers are volunteers, and we're always looking for more.

527
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:07,183
Ushers take tickets, help patrons find their seats, and then, of course, get to enjoy the concert for free.

528
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:13,650
If you're interested, be sure to check page four of your program booklet for more details.

529
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:16,419
Number 86.

530
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,643
Why does the speaker say?

531
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:23,569
Unfortunately, some of the microphones aren't working.

532
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,521
Number 87.

533
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,165
What are the listeners invited to do?

534
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,618
Number 88.

535
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:49,738
Where does the speaker say some information can be found?

536
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:01,971
Questions 89 through 91 refer to the following speech.

537
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:10,581
I'm Natalie from Akroy Technologies, and I'm here to train everyone on using System Ace, your new project management software.

538
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:15,026
Since you organize and provide a venue for professional conferences and trade shows,

539
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:19,079
System Ace will allow you to create separate project folders for each event.

540
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,750
This means that event-related to-do lists, schedules, and other documents for each folder will all be in one place.

541
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,435
Now, the best way to learn a new program is by using it.

542
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,079
So please get out your tablet or laptop.

543
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:35,042
We're going to try a few things together.

544
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:37,986
Number 89.

545
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:41,170
What is the focus of the training?

546
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:50,123
Number 90.

547
00:40:51,164 --> 00:41:01,597
Where do the listeners most likely work?

548
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:02,358
Number 91.

549
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,243
What does the speaker ask the listeners to do?

550
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:18,418
Questions 92 through 94 refer to the following talk.

551
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:28,336
In this online session, I'd like to discuss how small businesses like those represented here today can be more energy efficient.

552
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:34,365
For example, some companies install solar panels to reduce their electricity costs.

553
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:38,732
Now, we all have different ideas about how to conserve energy.

554
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,678
What does your company do to reduce its carbon footprint?

555
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:45,722
There's a lot of combined knowledge at this meeting.

556
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:48,146
Let's take advantage of that.

557
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,554
Please submit your questions and comments in the chat.

558
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:58,784
By the way, this session is being recorded so that it's available to all participants after the session.

559
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:01,689
Number 92.

560
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:04,713
What is the topic of the talk?

561
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:13,626
Number 93.

562
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:16,690
Why does the speaker say...

563
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:19,381
There's a lot of combined knowledge at this meeting.

564
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:28,335
Number 94.

565
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:32,801
What does the speaker say will happen after the talk?

566
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:46,642
Questions 95 through 97 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting and table.

567
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:49,656
Thanks for coming to this weekly briefing.

568
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:56,863
As you know, Joe's trucking company takes safety very seriously, and I'm glad all our drivers are able to attend today.

569
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:01,728
So we have five loads to deliver, including two loads of steel beams.

570
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:11,357
Yasushi, you've been assigned to the car carrier, so please be sure to follow the safety checklist, especially the part about securely fastening all restraints.

571
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:16,402
Junco, I'm concerned the lumber you're carrying will be considered oversized,

572
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,551
I think the company will need to obtain a permit for you.

573
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,294
We'll talk after the meeting.

574
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:24,579
Number 95.

575
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,464
Who most likely are the listeners?

576
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:36,479
Number 96.

577
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,626
What does the speaker remind Yasushi to do?

578
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,571
Number 97.

579
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:52,054
Look at the graphic.

580
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:55,479
Which load length is the speaker concerned about?

581
00:44:07,734 --> 00:44:13,662
Questions 98 through 100 refer to the following broadcast and map.

582
00:44:13,682 --> 00:44:16,946
Welcome to the evening news program on WXNL Radio.

583
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:24,450
In local news, the much-anticipated holiday parade will be held downtown this Saturday, beginning promptly at 10 a.m.

584
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:25,271
on Main Street.

585
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:30,278
However, according to the city government's website, there's been one important change.

586
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:41,792
The parade was supposed to follow a route along five city roads, but because of traffic concerns, the parade will now stop at the end of Curtis Avenue instead of continuing to the originally planned endpoint.

587
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:47,058
Now, in case you're wondering whether we'll have sunny skies or clouds on the day of the parade,

588
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,256
Stay tuned after the commercial break for our weekend forecast.

589
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,221
Number 98.

590
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:56,207
What will begin at 10 a.m.

591
00:44:56,347 --> 00:44:57,108
on Saturday?

592
00:45:05,343 --> 00:45:06,105
Number 99.

593
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:09,311
Look at the graphic.

594
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,154
Which road will be excluded?

595
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:24,328
Number 100.

596
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:28,370
What will the listeners hear after a commercial break?
