00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,640

00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:31,922
C.

169
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,104
No, I shut off all the lights.

170
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:40,114
Number 27.

171
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,741
Have you trained Hikaru to use the new microscope?

172
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,925
A. I have my own car.

173
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:51,070
B. That's enough, thanks.

174
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:55,076

00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:01,426
Number 28.

176
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:05,237
We're meeting this week to discuss the upcoming merger.

00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,600

Number 29.

181
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:26,037
How long will we have to wait for a taxi to arrive?

182
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,741
A. About 12 kilometers.

183
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:31,122
B.

184
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,096
No, I don't think so.

185
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,442
C. Would you prefer to walk?

186
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,552
Number 30.

187
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,597
Did the deal to lease the equipment go through?

188
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:48,902
A. A one-bedroom apartment.

189
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:53,310

Number 31.

192
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,060
Would you like to take this vehicle for a test drive?

193
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,905
A. Because there's no parking available.

194
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:16,171

196
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:25,342
Part 3.

197
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:26,704
Directions.

198
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:31,250
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

199
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:37,454
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

200
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:46,647
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

201
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:52,836
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

202
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:58,243
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

203
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:00,146
Mateo

204
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,293
Do you have time to help me organize the storage room?

205
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:07,939
The construction crew is going to be starting renovations on the lobby next week.

206
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,902
We need to make space to store the lobby furniture.

207
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:15,467
Actually, I know the plan is to replace those tables and chairs.

208
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,572
Maybe we should just donate them now rather than putting them in storage.

209
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:20,993
Good idea.

210
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:26,119
I'll do some research to see which organizations accept donations of furniture.

211
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,722
I'm sure there are several in the area.

212
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:31,575
Number 32.

213
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,902
According to the woman, what will happen next week?

214
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,276
Number 33.

215
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:47,879
What does the man recommend?

216
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,293
Number 34.

217
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,338
What does the woman say she will do?

218
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:14,289
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

219
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,411
Hi, Liam.

220
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:19,274
We're really glad to have you join our team.

221
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,518
The harvest season is our busiest.

222
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm excited to get started.

223
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,542
Let me introduce you to Brian.

224
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,786
He will take you out to the berry fields for your training.

225
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,027
Hi, Liam.

226
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:33,170
Here's a pair of gloves for you to use.

227
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:33,991
Thanks.

228
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,914
The berry picking is really straightforward.

229
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:42,168
But it's important that you get plenty of water and stay hydrated in this heat.

230
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:45,312
I brought a big bottle of it with me, so I should be fine.

231
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,776
Number 35.

232
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,080
Where do the speakers most likely work?

233
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,070
Number 36.

234
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,274
What does Brian give to Liam?

235
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:13,576
Number 37.

236
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,740
According to Brian, what is important?

237
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,855
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

238
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,999
Welcome to my gardening podcast.

239
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,690
I'm Rajesh Varma, and today I'm here with Sojin Lee, a botanist from Denton University who recently developed a new hybrid flower.

240
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,040
Could you tell us more, Professor Lee?

241
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,081
Certainly.

242
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:46,203
I developed a new type of rose.

243
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:49,687
It's special because it blooms longer than any other rose.

244
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:50,928
That's interesting.

245
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:52,570
Is it difficult to grow?

246
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,533
Not if it's planted under the right conditions.

247
00:16:56,253 --> 00:17:00,217
Next month, the rose will be featured at the botanical show downtown.

248
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:02,600
I hope your listeners will come to see it.

249
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:05,903
Number 38.

250
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:08,786
Who most likely is the man?

251
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,615
Number 39.

252
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,939

00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:30,948
Number 40.

254
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,370
What will happen next month?

255
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:46,002
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

256
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:51,682
So, Vivek, I think our employees could benefit from some more training.

257
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:55,468
How about using this software application that I found?

258
00:17:56,069 --> 00:18:03,642
The app provides a platform for uploading our own training videos, and employees could view them on their phones at any time.

259
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:11,275
You know, I've heard that those online programs help employees retain knowledge, but aren't those apps expensive?

260
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:13,298
Actually, the cost is reasonable.

261
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:19,036
And the website has some interesting reviews from other businesses that have used the app and found it helpful.

262
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,882
Number 41.

263
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,027
What does the woman propose doing?

264
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,044
Number 42.

265
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,170
What is the man concerned about?

266
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:45,875
Number 43.

267
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:50,480
According to the woman, what can be found on a website?

268
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:00,110
Go on to the next page.

269
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:09,800
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

270
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:11,922
Hi, Christina.

271
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:18,472
Did you have a chance to look over the applications from our sales representatives who are interested in the new team leader role?

272
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,216
We'll need to decide on a team leader soon.

273
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,198
I did.

274
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,203
I really liked Amanda Diop's application.

275
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:28,929
She's the one who signed that deal with Wallaston Corporation.

276
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,950
I agree.

277
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:31,653
That was an impressive deal.

278
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,398
Wallerston is one of our biggest clients now.

279
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,801
I think Amanda would be a great choice.

280
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:37,883
Okay.

281
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:39,666
I'm glad we're on the same page.

282
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:44,105
I'll complete the paperwork and send it to the Human Resources Department later today.

283
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,009
Number 44.

284
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:50,515
What are the speakers mainly discussing?

285
00:19:58,809 --> 00:19:59,970
Number 45.

286
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,658
According to the speakers, what has Amanda Diop accomplished?

287
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:13,467
Number 46.

288
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,772
What does the woman say she will do?

289
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:30,831
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

290
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:36,620
Thanks for agreeing to this interview for our upcoming article in the Thomasville Gazette, Ms.

291
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,601
Haddad.

292
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,322
Of course.

293
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:46,030
As you note, the City Council is proposing the implementation of a road tax, and I want to make sure the public is informed about it.

294
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,236
Well, we like to keep our readers in the know, so we have a long list of questions for you.

295
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:52,337
I'll start.

296
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,700
What does the city plan to do with this tax revenue, Ms.

297
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,141
Hadard?

298
00:20:56,701 --> 00:21:01,126
The money will be used to add bicycle lanes citywide, which I'm excited about.

299
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,850
Bicycle lanes should reduce traffic and promote health.

300
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:08,991
Some business owners are concerned about losing street parking.

301
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,653
Are you worried about that?

302
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:13,897
Number 47.

303
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,921

Number 48.

305
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:27,796
What is Ms.

306
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:29,298
Hadad excited about?

307
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,087
Number 49.

308
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,552

309

Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

310
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,012
Good morning, Ms.

311
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:56,953
Gomez.

312
00:21:56,973 --> 00:22:01,479
I wanted to update you on the travel plans for your meeting with Skani Department Store.

313
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,602
Thanks for taking care of that.

314
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:12,630
They're prospective clients, and I've been so busy sending them samples and preparing my presentation that I haven't given a thought to my reservations.

315
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,092
Happy to help.

316
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,414
I've confirmed your plane reservation.

317
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:21,959
Just remember, Villa Air only allows one free piece of carry-on luggage.

318
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:24,401
Otherwise, there'll be an extra charge.

319
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:25,422
Okay.

320
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:28,645
Can you forward the plane ticket confirmation, please?

321
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:30,647
I'll email you right now.

322
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,810

323
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,693

Number 51.

325
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:49,332
What does the man remind the woman about?

326
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:58,305
Number 52.

327
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,650
What does the man agree to do?

328
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:14,166
Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation.

329
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,890
Hi, I'm Marcel from Novick's Solutions.

330
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,553
Glad you could stop by my trade show booth today.

331
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,074
Nice to meet you.

332
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,697
I'm Sylvia from Media Futurescapes.

333
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,040
So what type of product does your company provide?

334
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,504
We create accounting software so that companies can do their own accounting.

335
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:37,529
Currently, I'm showcasing a new version for companies with under 50 employees.

336
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,450
Well...

337
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,616
We have about 200 employees.

338
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:41,717
I understand.

339
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:45,741
Here's a chart that provides an overview of our complete range of products.

340
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:48,724
Number 53.

341
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,167
Where are the speakers?

342
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:00,176
Number 54.

343
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:06,482
What does the woman mean when she says... We have about 200 employees.

344
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,311
Number 55.

345
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:18,715
What does the man give to the woman?

346
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:31,249
Questions 56 through 58 refer to the following conversation.

347
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:39,978
Rodrigo, aren't we scheduled to start the seal coating job for the street parking around Bevelton Shopping Center next week?

348
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,282
We were going to start those repairs on Monday.

349
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,060
But I've been looking at the weather.

350
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,062
It's going to rain all weekend.

351
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,465
I think we should reschedule.

352
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:49,846
Right.

353
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:53,690
We can't add a protective layer to the asphalt when it's wet.

354
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:58,997
I'll contact the property manager at the shopping center to discuss alternative dates.

355
00:24:59,517 --> 00:24:59,858
Okay.

356
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:06,626
Just so you know, we've received a few new requests for consultations on our road repair services.

357
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:09,510
I'll try to slot those in for Monday instead.

358
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,074
Number 56.

359
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:15,757
Who most likely are the speakers?

360
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,731
Number 57.

361
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,217
Why will a project be rescheduled?

362
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,111
Number 58.

363
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:41,458
What will the speakers most likely do on Monday?

364
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,951
Questions 59 through 61 refer to the following conversation.

365
00:25:53,992 --> 00:26:01,941
Tasneem, I've been looking at the production process for soaps in our facility, and I think there's room for improvement.

366
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,185
Improvements that could decrease our production time?

367
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:05,986
Yes.

368
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:07,108
Consider this.

369
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:13,736
Once the soap mixtures are poured into the moulds, employees have to carry the batches across the room.

370
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:15,538
I see what you mean.

371
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:21,290
If we reinstalled the drying racks closer to the mixing station, they wouldn't have to walk as far.

372
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,531
Exactly.

373
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:27,098
A small change like that can have a big effect on total output.

374
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:29,301
But wouldn't that be expensive?

375
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,804
Let me show you the cost projection.

376
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:34,749
Number 59.

377
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:38,514
Where do the speakers most likely work?

378
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:47,463
Number 60.

379
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:54,575
What does the man imply when he says... Employees have to carry the batches across the room.

380
00:26:54,595 --> 00:27:03,669
Number 61.

381
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,834
What will the man show the woman?

382
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:20,670
Question 62 through 64 refer to the following conversation and supply order.

383
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:26,458
I was just looking at the supply request form you submitted for our engineering department.

384
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:27,239
Yes.

385
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,422
I think you might have made a mistake.

386
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,526
Do we really need that many computer mousees?

387
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,450
Oh, that is a mistake.

388
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,273
I meant to request two.

389
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,035
Okay, great.

390
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:43,922
I did think that was strange, given that there are only 15 of us in our department.

391
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:45,728
Thanks for catching that.

392
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,151
Do you know when the supplies will get here?

393
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:52,616
I'll place the order this afternoon, so they'll probably arrive next week.

394
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:55,660
Number 62.

395
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,144
What department do the speakers work in?

396
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:08,276
Number 63.

397
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:11,419
Look at the graphic.

398
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,522
Which quantity needs to be changed?

399
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,379
Number 64.

400
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,403
What does the woman ask about?

401
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:39,096
Go on to the next page.

402
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:50,311
Question 65 through 67 refer to the following conversation and pricing list.

403
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,255
Welcome to Halcyon Florals.

404
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:54,417
How can I help you?

405
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,218
Hi.

406
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:59,088
I'm planning the Lambert Evans' wedding that's taking place this weekend.

407
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:04,837
I received an email this morning that there's a problem with the flowers I ordered for the floral arrangements.

408
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:10,986
Yes, unfortunately, my supplier notified me that they're out of stock because of a shortage.

409
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:14,913
I'm sorry, but you'll have to choose a replacement for the lilies.

410
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,880
I know my client likes orchids, but I'm guessing those are too expensive.

411
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,506
We'll still need a flower that's under $5 per stem.

412
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,188
Well, what about these?

413
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:27,010
They fit within your budget.

414
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:31,135
Those will be perfect.

415
00:29:31,155 --> 00:29:31,896
Number 65.

416
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,881
What type of event are the speakers discussing?

417
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:44,893
Number 66.

418
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:49,298
According to the woman, what has caused a problem?

419
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,211
Number 67.

420
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:00,634
Look at the graphic.

421
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:04,078
Which flowers will be used in the arrangements?

422
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:21,480
Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and storefront.

423
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:26,706
I think I've inspected enough to determine a fair market value for your store.

424
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:27,615
Okay.

425
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:32,142
You have the paperwork verifying that I replaced my roof last year, right?

426
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:35,386
Buyers look for properties that don't need major repairs.

427
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:36,728
I do have that.

428
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,830
And you're right.

429
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:41,395
Recent repairs are a factor that add to the value of a property.

430
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,580
The historic windows will be a selling point, I think.

431
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,543
They're made of hand-blown glass.

432
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,568
All the storefronts in this row of shops have them.

433
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:51,330
They do add character.

434
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:56,498
Now, I need to walk around with my camera to take some photos to file with my paperwork.

435
00:30:58,594 --> 00:30:59,476
Number 68.

436
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:03,122
What is the man most likely planning to do?

437
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:12,238
Number 69.

438
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,643
Look at the graphic.

439
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:18,770
Which part of the storefront does the man say is historic?

440
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:31,707
Number 70.

441
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,230
What will the woman do next?

442
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,221
Part 4.

443
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:48,567
Directions You will hear some talks given by a single speaker.

444
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:54,434
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speaker says in each talk.

445
00:31:55,336 --> 00:32:00,722
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, B,

446
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:03,482
C or D on your answer sheet.

447
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:09,511
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

448
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:15,620
Question 71 through 73 refer to the following advertisement.

449
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,584

464
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:41,721
For the rest of today, it is expected to remain dry and cloudy in the Jonesdale area.

465
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:47,108
But beginning tomorrow, we'll see colder temperatures and moderate snowfall.

466
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,475
So please remember to put on a heavy coat if you plan on doing anything outdoors.

467
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:57,362
As we head into next week, it'll finally start to feel like spring.

468
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:05,610
Okay, next up, we'll be covering our local sports team's recent events, including a big victory last night.

469
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:08,675
Number 74.

470
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:12,180
What is the broadcast mainly about?

471
00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:21,213

Question 77 through 79, refer to the following telephone message.

476
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:56,110
This is brilliant watch repair calling about the antique wristwatch that you dropped off yesterday.

477
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:02,418
As you mentioned, one of the watch hands was frequently skipping ahead, so we replace the battery.

478
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:04,504
That seemed to fix the issue.

479
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:09,652
However, because the watch is quite old, we also took it apart to give it a good cleaning.

480
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:16,642
In the future, we suggest bringing it in for basic maintenance once every three years to keep it in good condition.

481
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,326
The watch is ready for you at any time.

482
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:23,512
Just be aware that tomorrow is a national holiday and will be closed.

483
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:24,333
Thanks.

484
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:27,478
Number 77.

485
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,482

486
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:39,463

Questions 80 through 82 refer to the following speech.

491
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:15,120
We're here tonight to celebrate Fritz Schneider's outstanding service to the company on the eve of his retirement.

492
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:21,570
Fritz has been with Elta Footwear since its inception, and without him, we wouldn't be where we are today.

493
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:27,880
With unfailing optimism, he has provided consistent leadership to help us grow as a company.

494
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:34,109
Thanks largely to his efforts, today we produce more than 25 lines of athletic footwear.

495
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,074
We'll miss him, but we wish him well.

496
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,899
And now I'd like to share a short video with some highlights of Fritz's many years with Elta.

497
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:45,844
Number 80.

Questions 83 through 85 refer to the following telephone message.

505
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:35,986
This is Yulia, the building manager.

506
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:43,709
I'm calling to let you know that workers are coming tomorrow morning to replace a defective water pipe under the pavement in front of your apartment.

507
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:51,501
It should only take a few hours to complete, but I know you sometimes work from home, and they'll be using loud machinery.

508
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,925
Sorry this is such short notice.

509
00:37:54,546 --> 00:38:00,835
Part of the pipe runs next to a telephone pole, so I was required to apply for a permit to have the work done safely.

510
00:38:01,356 --> 00:38:05,362
I thought approval would take at least a week, but it was issued yesterday.

511
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:09,505
Number 83.

Questions 86 through 88 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

519
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:56,026
I called this quick meeting for hospital staff.

520
00:38:56,046 --> 00:39:00,550
Our wireless internet has gone down and we are in the process of getting it restored.

521
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:04,114
But don't worry, hardwired access is still available.

522
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:11,566
so all doctors, nurses and essential staff will still be able to use the desktop computers at each workstation.

523
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:16,454
However, our patients will be wondering why they can't connect to the Wi-Fi.

524
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:19,500
So please remember to let them know what's going on.

525
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:22,444
Number 86.

526

532
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:11,314
As a consulting nutritionist, I'll work with your company cafeteria to review the items that are currently sold and suggest updates.

533
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:16,960
Consuming less meat is not only better for our health, but is also better for the environment.

534
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:29,874
And consider this interesting fact, a recent study of thousands of cafeteria meals shows that when additional vegetarian options are offered, there is a significant increase in the number of vegetarian meals consumed.

535
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:35,445
Some of you have expressed concern that I might ask you to completely overhaul the entire menu.

536
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:41,612
Well, small changes can have surprising results.

537
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:42,333

538

544
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,645
We've received feedback from one of our major clients.

545
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:34,290
The most recent advertisements we created for social media...

546
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:38,898
increased traffic to our client's website by 20%, which is great.

547
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,243
In other news, we're on track to exceed our annual goal in terms of revenue.

548
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:51,970
Having said that, 40% of our business comes from two clients, and either could back out at any time.

549
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:57,896
We plan to ask existing clients to recommend our ad services to their business contacts.

550
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:04,402
As an incentive, we'll offer a discount to those whose referrals result in new business for us.

I have a few quick announcements.

560
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:04,530
First, thank you to all of our vendors.

561
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:11,503
They were selected because they use sustainable, environmentally friendly practices to produce their goods.

562
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:15,889
We know protecting the environment is important to our community.

563
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,996

What a phenomenal speech.
