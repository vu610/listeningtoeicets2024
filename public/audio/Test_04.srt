167
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:25,229
C. I'll buy mine at the door.

168
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,275
Number 26.

169
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,879
When are they going to decide who to hire?

170
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,322
A. A much higher salary.

171
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,399
B. A lot of good resumes have come in.

172
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,984

173
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,374
Number 27.

174
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:56,219
I had a chance to look over the contract this morning.

00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,865

176
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,069
B. Early next week.

177
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,354

178
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,195
Number 28.

179
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,799
How are the database updates coming along?

180
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,224
A. I've been really busy with the Williams account.

181
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,587
B. Some customer addresses.

182
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,231
C. She arrives on Wednesday.

183
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:33,638
Number 29.

184
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,082
When can I bring these boxes into the warehouse?

185
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:38,484
A.

186
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,626
10 in a package.

187
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:44,071
B. Thanks, I just bought it.

188
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,917
C. We'll need to clear some space.

189
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,067
Number 30.

190
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,293
The market on Fifth Street is closed for a week.

191
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,338

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,391
Number 31.

00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,777
Does the company pay for professional development courses?

00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,903
A. Insook helped develop a new product.

197
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:26,369

199
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,082
Part 3.

200
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:37,584
Directions.

201
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:42,290
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

202
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:48,687
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

203
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:57,981
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

204
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:04,350
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

205
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:09,999
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

206
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,242
Excuse me?

207
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,924
But wasn't the ferry to Osaka supposed to leave at 10 o'clock?

208
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:21,149
Yes, but the Port Authority has suspended all marine traffic due to rough water.

209
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,010
I see.

210
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,234
Does that mean ferries are cancelled all day?

211
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:28,418
This storm is expected to pass in about three hours.

212
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,362
But operations should return to normal after that.

213
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:33,565
Your ticket will be good until midnight.

214
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:37,069
Okay, then I guess I'll grab some lunch nearby.

215
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,914
I highly recommend Mary's Cafe for sandwiches and soup.

216
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:43,767
Number 32.

217
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,313
Where most likely are the speakers?

218
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:56,326
Number 33.

219
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,831
What problem does the man mention?

220
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,366
Number 34.

221
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,210
What will the woman do next?

222
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:24,744
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

223
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:26,586
Good morning.

224
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:30,612
Are you looking for any particular library book, magazine, or newspaper?

225
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:31,853
Actually, no.

226
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:36,339
I'm here because I got an email this morning telling me that I have an overdue book.

227
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,463
But I returned it to the after-hours bin last night.

228
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:44,870
Sometimes a book gets returned and put back on the shelves without being entered into the system first.

229
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:46,072
I can take a look.

230
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:47,794
Can you tell me the title?

231
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,199
Number 35.

232
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,102
Who most likely is the woman?

233
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,591
Number 36.

234
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,094
What does the man say happened this morning?

235
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,563
Number 37.

236
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,506
What does the woman offer to do?

237
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,535
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

238
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,018
Hi, I'm Malik.

239
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,844
I talked to you this morning on the phone about a price quote for some painting you want done.

240
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:39,986
Oh, hi.

241
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:40,646
Come in.

242
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:41,267
Yes.

243
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:44,992
I want to change the colour in the dining room to something lighter.

244
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,193
Not a problem.

245
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:56,306
But I do want to stress that the quote may be higher than you expected because going from a darker colour to a lighter one requires more than one coat of paint.

246
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,591
I understand.

247
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,477
And will you move the table and chairs out of the room before you start?

248
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:03,399
That shouldn't be necessary.

249
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,542
We can cover them with a drop cloth.

250
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:08,907
Number 38.

251
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:13,093
What type of business does the man most likely work for?

252
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:22,506
Number 39.

253
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,650
What point does the man emphasize?

254
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:34,563
Number 40.

255
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:37,427
What does the woman ask about?

256
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:49,864
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

257
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,429
Hi, this is my first time in here.

258
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:54,450
Nice place.

259
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:58,255
Looks like you've got lots of state-of-the-art equipment.

260
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:00,338
Yes, we just opened this week.

261
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:05,489
All the exercise bikes, treadmills and workout stations that you see are brand new.

262
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:06,570
Great.

263
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,573
I'm considering joining.

264
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,816
My office is right around the corner.

265
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:14,521
Well, here's a brochure with a description of our membership levels.

266
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,584
I'm happy to answer any questions.

267
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:17,465
Thanks.

268
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,128
I do like to swim a few times a week.

269
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,170
Do you have a pool?

270
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,131
We do.

271
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:26,677
Why don't we start by walking around so I can show you all of our facilities?

272
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,162
Number 41.

273
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,391
Where does the man work?

274
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,301
Number 42.

275
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:44,805
What is the purpose of the woman's visit?

276
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:53,674
Number 43.

277
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:57,458
What will the woman most likely do next?

278
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,008
Go on to the next page.

279
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,677
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

280
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:18,239
Hello.

281
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,661
What brings you into our leasing office today?

282
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:21,462
Hi.

283
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:28,869
I currently live in Unit 217, but I'm wondering if there are any larger units available to rent in the building.

284
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,431
Let me see.

285
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:33,554
Apartment 410 is quite large.

286
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:35,562
And the lease on it ends this November.

287
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:37,225
It's a thousand per month.

288
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:38,447
Does that interest you?

289
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:42,977
I did just get promoted at work recently, so I can afford to spend more.

290
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,121
So that won't be a problem.

291
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:45,962
Great.

292
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:49,530
I'll call the current tenant, and we can figure out a time for a viewing.

293
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,375
Number 44.

294
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,762
Who most likely is the man?

295
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:05,000
Number 45.

296
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,384
What does the woman say recently happened?

297
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:17,276
Number 46.

298
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,461
What will the man do next?

299
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:33,298
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

300
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,031
Hello, Ms.

301
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:35,572
Bajaj.

302
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,497
I'm glad we have a chance to meet today to discuss your business.

303
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:42,041
What's your company's main goal?

304
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:47,348
Well, recently my craft supply store has started receiving a lot of online orders.

305
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,894
It's important that I get feedback from those customers about the products that I'm selling.

306
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,718
We can design an online survey for you.

307
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:59,845
It's automatically emailed out to your customers a week after their order is delivered.

308
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,250
We've had a lot of success getting people to respond to those.

309
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:04,503
That's a great idea.

310
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:09,188
Then perhaps I could offer a future discount to any customer who completes the survey.

311
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:11,971
Number 47.

312
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,277
According to the woman, what has recently happened at her business?

313
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:26,547
Number 48.

314
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:29,330
What can the man's company do?

315
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:38,195
Number 49.

316
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,459
What does the woman say she could offer her customers?

317
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:56,152
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

318
00:21:57,373 --> 00:22:01,477
Hello, I'm from District Flower Store, and I have your centerpiece order.

319
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:04,159
Let me get the hotel's event manager here.

320
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,621
She's the one that ordered.

321
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:06,802
Yulia?

322
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:09,810
You have a delivery from district flower store at reception.

323
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,974
Hi, I'm glad you're early.

324
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,780
The wedding's this evening, but we're already setting up the ballroom.

325
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,923
I'll need you to acknowledge receipt.

326
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,245
Could you sign here?

327
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,111
And then, where should I unload your color lilysses?

328
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:24,613
Cala lilies?

329
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:28,079
I ordered lilacs for the wedding centerpieces.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,981
Oh, I wouldn't know.

331
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:31,103
I just deliver.

332
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,327
Well, let me call your boss.

333
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,570
We need to sort it out right away.

334
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,451
Number 50.

335
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,594
Where most likely are the speakers?

336
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:50,542
Number 51.

337
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:54,326
What type of event is going to take place?

338
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:03,295
Number 52.

339
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,738

340
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:20,525
Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

341
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:22,527
Excuse me, Ms.

342
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:22,868
Campbell.

343
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:29,556
My engineer, Edisa, is still on your roof, but I just wanted to let you know we're almost done with the inspection.

344
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,258
How does everything look?

345
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:32,860
Oh, here's Edisa now.

346
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,801
He can answer that.

347
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,284
I conducted a thorough inspection.

348
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:38,407
There's no structural damage.

349
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,850
All of the support beams are intact.

350
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:45,188
But we'll have to replace some of the shingles that were blown away in the storm.

351
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,231
Well, that's a relief.

352
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,715
I was worried that I'd need major repairs.

353
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:53,421
I'm afraid you'll have to close your store while we replace the shingles.

354
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:56,186
But we'll be able to finish in one day.

355
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,908
Does Tuesday work for you?

356
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,030
That's fine.

357
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:01,935
Number 53.

358
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,482
What kind of business do the men most likely work for?

359
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:15,343
Number 54.

360
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:18,466
Why is the woman relieved?

361
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:27,877
Number 55.

362
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,860

Hi, Arena.

365
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,610
I'm sorry about missing the morning meeting.

366
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,532
My commute was horrendous.

367
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:50,774
No worries.

368
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:52,837
The meeting notes will be sent out.

369
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:53,878
What happened?

370
00:24:54,379 --> 00:25:00,446
The metro system's renovating some station platforms, and it added an extra half hour to my commute.

371
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:05,973
Trains in both directions are only using one track, and the trains my only option.

372
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:09,458
Well, there is a rapid transit bus service.

373
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,900
I wasn't aware of that.

374
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,722
I'm still new to this city.

375
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:14,564
How do I get more information?

376
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:17,889
I'll send you links to their website and system map.

377
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:20,874
Number 56.

378
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:24,119
Why does the man apologize?

379
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,533
Number 57.

380
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:39,762

381
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,507
Number 58.

382
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:59,585

385
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,076
Good to see you again.

386
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:11,363
My consultancy firm has been working hard to help you grow your clothing company.

387
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:12,264
Thanks.

388
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:15,890
I never expected so much attention for my clothing designs.

389
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,944
But I'm so pleased with the reactions.

390
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:18,624
Okay.

391
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,447
What do you think about approaching Regents' department stores?

392
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,530
They usually market to a younger clientele.

393
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,411
I see.

394
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,874
Let me get you a list of other stores we also had in mind.

395
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:31,837
Number 59.

396
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:34,199
Who is the woman?

397
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:43,368
Number 60.

398
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,970
Why does the woman say?

399
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:57,328
they usually market to a younger clientele.

400
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,111
Number 61.

401
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:02,162
What does the man say he will give the woman?

402
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:16,420
Question 62 through 64 refer to the following conversation and employee directory.

403
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:21,746
Louise, I noticed something while I was directing yesterday's rehearsal.

404
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:27,231
I had a problem while I was trying to give some directions to the actors during Act 3.

405
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:31,135
I wanted to ask you about it since you're in charge of lighting.

406
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:32,717
Sure, what is it?

407
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:37,522
One of the footlights at the front of the stage was flickering, which was distracting.

408
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,228
It made it hard to see the actor's faces and costumes.

409
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,311
Can you do something to fix it?

410
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:45,955
Actually, I've already ordered a replacement.

411
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:47,338
It should be here tomorrow.

412
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:48,199
Great.

413
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,940
Thanks.

414
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,086
I can't believe opening night is next week.

415
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:55,011
Everyone has put so much work into the show.

416
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,274
It'll be great to have an audience.

417
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:00,319
Number 62.

418
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:02,663
Look at the graphic.

419

Number 63.

421
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:20,752
What problem do the speakers discuss?

422
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:29,564
Number 64.

423
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,528

Question 65 through 67 refer to the following conversation and webpage.

426
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,103
Hey, Hi Hiroko, I got the email invite to the company retreat.

427
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:02,088
I'm surprised that it's in June this year instead of September.

428
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:05,753
Yeah, we changed the date so we could try out this venue.

429
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,677
I taught it last month and was really impressed.

430
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,980
The rooms especially are so comfortable.

431
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,583
There weren't any openings in September, though.

432
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,146
I'm sure it will be worth the change.

433
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:19,542
Your team in Human Resources plans great events.

434
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:22,165
Here, I just pulled up their website.

435
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,026
Take a look.

436
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:27,112
Staff can choose one of these activities on the second day of the retreat.

437
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,294
I've never been kayaking.

438
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:31,858
This looks like a good chance to try it.

439
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:34,842
Number 65.

440
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,226

Number 66.

442
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,828

Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and site map.

447

Hi, you must be with the camera crew.

448
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:26,987
I'm Hector.

449
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:30,291
Head archaeologist here at the Arnault Castle Dig site.

450
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:31,732
Nice to meet you.

451
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:32,734
I'm Ling.

452
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:40,842
Since it's our first day of filming for our TV documentary special, we're mainly going to capture general footage of your team at work.

453
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:41,743
Great.

454
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:43,705
We're working in Quadrant 2 today.

455
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:48,050
We've been finding lots of pottery, so you may capture us unearthing more.

456
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:49,063
I see.

457
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:52,789
This excavation has been a lengthy process, right?

458
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:53,831
It has.

459
00:30:54,512 --> 00:31:00,741
We'd actually hope to be further along, but there have been lots of thunderstorms lately, which have slowed things down.

460
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:03,786

471
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:09,454

472
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:15,762
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

473

00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:53,649

This weekend we'll be installing new security software on our internal servers.

487
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,153
This is a little more involved in the routine update.

488
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:54,199
We need to have an extra layer of protection on our customer's personal data.

489
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,404
So we're all being asked to help prepare for this event.

490
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:02,532
Before we leave the office on Friday, we'll need to shut down our computers to enable the patch.

491
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:08,481
Marta Fuentes is here to explain how we'll finish the installation on our devices when we come in on Monday.

00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:11,986

500
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,554
This also means that our usual parking lot won't be available.

501
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:09,615
But don't worry.

502
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:13,340
There's plenty of space in the parking garage next to the J building.

503
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:20,850
For your convenience, the company will be providing a van service that will run every 15 minutes until the project is completed.

504
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:23,886
The van will operate between 7 and 9 a.m.

505
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,571
and then again between 4 and 6 p.m.

506
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:31,419

Questions 80 through 82 refer to the following telephone message.

Hi, Asakow.

515
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:23,904
I'm following up about the hotel you asked me to book for our client visiting from India next month.

516
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:29,130
You wanted to reserve a room for her at the Maple Lodge, but it's fully booked that week.

517
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:34,697
So I've been looking at other hotels in the area, and there is one on Jefferson Avenue.

518
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:38,581
It's a little farther from our office, but it looks like a nice place.

519
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:43,647
They also have a complimentary shuttle bus that can take our guest back and forth from our office.

520
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,173
Call me and let me know what you think.

529
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:43,253
I'd like to start by giving everyone an update on our latest project.

530
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:51,242
As you know, in order to stay on top as a leading shipping company, we need to continually make changes to meet our customers' expectations.

531
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:55,026
Since our customers prefer doing almost everything digitally,

532
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:58,029
we're going to introduce a new delivery tracking service.

533
00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:04,135
By using a smartphone application, customers will be able to see where their package is in real time.

534
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:09,600
Of course, implementing this will be a major project for us and will take place over the coming year.

535
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:16,507
So next month, we'll begin working with developers from XKP Software on creating this tracking service.

00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:19,329
Number 83.

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,453
We were able to beat the other networks in getting that interview to the public.

545
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:21,404
I wanted to give you all a heads up that next month will be providing a behind-the-scenes tour for students who are exploring our field as a potential career path.

546
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:26,770
They'll see things like the assignment coordination desk, our studios, and the control room.

547
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,075
I'm looking for a few volunteers who can spare an hour of their time to do this.

548
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,459

00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:31,058
You've all done such a great job selling our ovens and refrigerators that we've already exceeded our sales expectations for the year.

558
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:36,083
To celebrate, we'd like to invite the sales team to join us for a company dinner.

I founded this tour company five years ago, and I'm happy to announce that next month my company is expanding its offerings.

570
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:59,538
We're launching a new walking tour that will focus on the various murals and statues located throughout the city center.

571
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:08,531
We know tourists like you often visit the exhibitions at our art museum, but art isn't only inside the walls of a museum.

581
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:22,578
Spokesperson Claudia Schneider explained that the agency initially considered a more elaborate design with a projected cost of $300 million.

582
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:30,014
but ultimately decided to go with a more cost-effective and straightforward proposal, with a price tag of $250 million.

583
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:34,758

In particular, this building is equipped with a water recycling system,

595

and insulation made from repurposed cloth.

596
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:12,391
