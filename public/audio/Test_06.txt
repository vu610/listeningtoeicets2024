A. The plants need more water.

169
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,074
B. Sorry, refunds are not allowed.

170
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:17,938

Number 26.

172
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,884
Should we meet to discuss our research project?

174
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:34,270
B. Put something on my calendar.

175
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,154

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,121

177
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,585

Number 29.

188
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,165
It's an effective advertisement, isn't it?

189
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,750
A. I've heard that sales have increased.

190
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,516
B. The next issue of the magazine.

191
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:38,442

00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:44,511
Number 30.

193
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,455

Directions.

203
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:33,267
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

204
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:39,776
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

205
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:49,069
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

206
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,538
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

207
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:01,085
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

208
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:05,592
The renovations we're planning for the theatre are long overdue.

209
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:09,699
I'm glad we have time between productions so we can get the work done.

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,700
I agree.

211
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,571
And even though it's great that our latest musical production has had such a successful run, we can all use the break.

212
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:21,778
Plus, it gives us time to focus on next month's fundraiser.

213
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:26,554
Hopefully we'll raise enough money at that event to replace the old lighting system too.

214
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:29,499
Number 32.

215
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,126
What are the speakers mainly discussing?

216
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,122
Number 33.

217
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:46,290
What does the man say about a musical production?

218
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,687
Number 34.

219
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,551
What event are the speakers planning?

220
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,305
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

221
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:19,454
Fernanda, I wanted to tell you that the top candidate we chose for the customer care position just accepted our job offer.

222
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,877
I'll send him a contract later today.

223
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,058
Great.

224
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,794
But now I think we need a bigger office space for our business.

225
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:30,279
With the new hire, there will be 10 of us in the office.

226
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,240
I agree.

227
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:36,286
Our lease expires next month, so we should look at a different space.

228
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,489
There's a new office building on 2nd Street.

229
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,515
It has solar panels, so all of its energy comes from renewable sources.

230
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:48,061
I like that, but I'm worried we may not be able to afford the lease.

231
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:49,063
We'll see.

232
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:51,826
I'll contact the rental agency today.

233
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,168
Number 35.

234
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,091
What did the speakers recently do?

235
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:07,583
Number 36.

236
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,647
What do the speakers like about a building?

237
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:20,099
Number 37.

238
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,802
What is the woman worried about?

239
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,776
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

240
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,919
How can I help you?

241
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,185
Hi, I'd like to order a cake for my son's birthday next week.

242
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:43,589
He really likes dinosaurs.

243
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,775
I have several different dinosaur-shaped pans for you to choose from.

244
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,462
Actually, I was hoping you could make a standing cake instead of a flat one.

245
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,184
Oh, I see.

246
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,266
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,290
I do have someone on staff who can make those.

248
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,729
But she's all booked up for the next few weeks.

249
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,153
Try Carmen's creations on Pine Street.

250
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,136
Number 38.

251
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,240
What event is the woman planning?

252
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:19,591
Number 39.

253
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,514
Who most likely is the man?

254
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:31,407
Number 40.

255
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,211
Why does the man apologize?

256
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:46,748
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

257
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,013
Hello, you've reached quick phone repair service.

258
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:58,043
Hi, I went online to schedule a repair for my mobile phone, but all appointments in your store were booked for today.

259
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,306
Have you had any cancellations?

260
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,381
No, unfortunately not.

261
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,524
What's the problem with your phone?

262
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:08,551
The phone only lasts about an hour before it has to be recharged.

263
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:10,774
It sounds like you need a new battery.

264
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:15,161
If you come to the store now, we can try to fit you in as a walk-in appointment.

265
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:17,165
You may have to wait around for a bit.

266
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:18,928
I don't mind waiting.

267
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:21,872
Number 41.

268
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,458
What did the man try to do online?

269
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:34,299
Number 42.

270
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,565
What does the man say is wrong with his mobile phone?

271
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:47,516
Number 43.

272
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:51,101
What will the man most likely do next?

273
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,914
Go on to the next page.

275
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:15,849
Asako, how far along are you on that news report about the bank merger?

276
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,978
If you wanted to be included in tomorrow morning's newspaper, it has to be on my desk by 9 p.m.

277
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,083
Well, I'm still doing research for this article.

278
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:28,748
I'm having trouble getting all the facts from the people involved.

279
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:30,851
They haven't returned my phone calls.

280
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:35,218
Well, we can't print the story without confirming the details.

281
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:40,380
But if you can have it finished by Wednesday night, I can put it in Thursday's paper.

282
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:43,604
Number 44.

283
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,829
Where do the speakers most likely work?

284
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,680
Number 45.

285
00:19:57,182 --> 00:20:00,146
Why has the woman been unable to finish a task?

286
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:08,967
Number 46.

287
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,410
What solution does the man propose?

288
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:25,204
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

289
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:33,032
We'll have to remove the soil from the garden bed and lay down drain pipes that'll take the water out through holes in the retaining wall.

290
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,314
Sounds like a lot of work.

291
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:38,546
But it'll be worth it to be able to grow the garden that I want to.

292
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:42,532
Do you think you'd like bricks or stones for the retaining wall?

293
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:48,481
Many homeowners prefer brick because it creates a nice, uniform look, but stones will last longer.

294
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,503
They are more expensive, though.

295
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,807
I don't want to have to make repairs.

296
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:55,891
You have several different kinds of stones to choose from.

297
00:20:56,592 --> 00:21:00,097
I have some pictures of projects I've completed in the past you can look at.

298
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,442
Number 47

299
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,185
What kind of work does the man do?

300
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:15,218
Number 48.

301
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,508
What does the woman imply when she says, I don't want to have to make repairs?

302
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,461
Number 49.

303
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:33,746
What will the man show to the woman show to the woman?

304
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:46,084
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

305
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:47,866

00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:49,709
You've reached accounts payable.

307
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,673
Hi, I'm calling from the editorial department.

308
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:58,160
One of our freelance writers has not received payment yet, so I'm calling to inquire about it.

309
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,263
Her contract number is 9356.

310
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,448
Okay, let me check.

311
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,410
Hmm.

312
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,114
It looks like she should have been paid last week.

313
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:11,926
But Adem handles those requests and he was on vacation.

314
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,029
He's just catching up today.

315
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,454
Do you have an estimate of how long it will take to process the request?

316
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,037
I'm not sure, but I can speak to Adem.

317
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,101
Number 50.

318
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,424
Why is the man calling?

319
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:35,435
Number 51.

320
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:37,938
According to the woman...

321
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,416
What caused a delay?

322
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:48,507
Number 52.

323
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,113
What information will the woman most likely provide later?

324
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:07,250
Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

325
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:13,875
I'm the general manager here at Revit Auto Repair, and this is Mr. Singh, our service manager.

326

We're eager to hear how your product can benefit our shop.

327
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,707
Well, my product is called Video Room.

328
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:25,755
It's a library of short videos that your business can offer in the waiting room.

329
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:32,065
These videos will explain common auto repairs and educate your customers on the repair process.

330
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:34,930
Can we add our own customized content?

331
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:38,671
I'd love to include a description of our exclusive lifetime warranty.

332
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:39,713
Yes.

333
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:43,798
And can we also add at-home auto care advice?

334
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:46,863
Number 53.

335
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,268
Where does the conversation take place?

336
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,260
Number 54.

337
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:03,186

Number 55.

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,051

Questions 56 through 58 refer to the following conversation.

341
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:29,508
Hi, Carmen.

342
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,954
I've just reviewed the outline you gave me for the nature documentary we're making.

343
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,999
I think it'll be a great film, but I'm a bit concerned.

344
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,562
I want it to be less than an hour.

345
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:41,824
I understand.

346
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:47,736
I'll take another look at it and see where I can take out some unnecessary scenes from the storyboard.

347
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:48,618
Great.

348
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:55,552
In the meantime, I need to follow up with our camera team to make sure they have all the equipment they need to begin filming.

349
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:58,437
Number 56.

350
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,706
What industry do the speakers most likely work in?

351
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:11,980
Number 57.

352
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:17,651
What does the man imply when he says, I want it to be less than an hour?

353
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:26,647
Number 58.

354
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,354
Why does the man need to contact a team?

355
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:44,191
Questions 59 through 61 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

356
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:53,360
Creti and Melissa I reviewed the results of the soil tests yesterday and most of the sports fields we manage have healthy soil.

357
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:59,766
But unfortunately, the baseball field on Smith Drive has elevated levels of potassium.

358
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:03,150
The grass on that field is so brown and weedy.

359
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,451
Now we know why.

360
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:07,794
We'll need to order some special fertilizer to put on it.

361
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:10,329
Do you think we need approval to do that?

362
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,997
Yes, since it's an unforeseen expense, it has to be approved by the acquisitions department.

363
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:20,181
Melissa, do you have time to prepare a cost estimate?

364
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:22,304
Sure, it won't take long.

365
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:26,670
I'll send it by lunchtime, and I'll CC you both on the email.

366
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:29,534
Number 59.

367
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:32,978
What did the man review yesterday?

368
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,991
Number 60.

369
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,595

370
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:53,749
Number 61.

371
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,174
What will Melissa send by email?

372
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:10,834
Question 62 through 64 refer to the following conversation and schedule.

373
00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:16,668
Rodrigo, you wanted to talk to me about the schedule for the bowling leagues at our alley?

374
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:17,529
Yes.

375
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:23,015
As you know, many of the members in the adult league have young children who participate in the junior league.

376
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:29,723
And they explained to me that it would be really convenient if we moved the junior league to the same night that the adult league plays.

377
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:32,406
That way they could all come together on the same night.

378
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:33,988
That's a great idea.

379
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:39,314
We have a few available bowling lanes on that day that the junior league can use.

380
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:45,265
I'll email the parents of the junior bowlers and let them know the day will change starting next month.

381
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:48,208
Number 62.

382
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:59,281
Where do the speakers work?

383
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,062
Number 63.

384
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:03,146

385
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:06,770
On which day will the junior league meet starting next month?

386
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:19,607
Number 64.

387
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,831

389
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,316
Question 65 through 67 refer to the following conversation and calendar.

390
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:47,762
Hi, where can I find a schedule of library events?

391
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,868
Oh, I've got it right here.

392
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:54,452
We usually have events almost every day, but we're closed this Friday.

393
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,555
The library is being used for the district elections.

394
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:58,276
I see.

395
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,078
Are there any movies showing?

396
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:00,899
Yes.

397
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,061
There's one on Thursday evening.

398
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:04,442
Oh, too bad.

399
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:07,265
I'm away for a client meeting on Thursday.

400
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:12,730
Well, if you like Sumit Mehta's books, you might be interested in his book signing.

401
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,552
I do like his novels.

402
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:15,233
Thanks.

403
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:16,434
I'll come back for that.

404
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,715
Number 65.

405
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:24,861
According to the woman, why will the library be closed on Friday?

406
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:33,871
Number 66.

407
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,715
What schedule conflict does the man mention?

408
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:47,346
Number 67.

409
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,231
Look at the graphic.

410
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:53,276
When will the man most likely attend a library event?

411
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:10,918
Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and paint options.

412
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,320
Good news, Tariq.

413
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:17,906
We'll have enough money to make those repairs to the bridge over the fish pond that you mentioned.

414
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:21,602
We've been awarded a grant to make some repairs to the park grounds.

415
00:30:22,102 --> 00:30:22,723
That's great.

416
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:26,628
That bridge needs a new coat of paint to protect it from the elements.

417
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:31,333
I think I sent you a list of paint colours when I first talked to you about the project.

418
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:32,455
You did.

419
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:45,650
Because it's such an iconic symbol of the park, and it's in so many photographs, we want it to be as close to the original colour as when it was first built, even though that's the most expensive option on the list.

420
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,551
Number 68.

421
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,374

430
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:52,621
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C or D on your answer sheet.

431
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:58,828
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

432
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,617
Question 71 through 73 refer to the following talk.

433
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,999
Hi everyone, big news.

434
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,682
Our clinic is getting a check-in kiosk.

435
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:18,388
What this means is that patients will be able to check themselves into their medical appointments by clicking through some buttons in the kiosk.

436
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:20,290
You will no longer have to do it for them.

437
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:26,899
I know all of you have been very busy answering phones, scheduling appointments and checking patients in.

438
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,323
So hopefully this helps to make your work easier.

439
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:38,192
We'll have a very short training session next Tuesday on how the check-in kiosk works.

491
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:34,462
The drain is completely clogged so the water won't go down.

492
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:38,728
I've tried a few different drain cleaning products, but they didn't help.

493
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,051
I think I've done all I can do.

494
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:44,055
I'm at work now, but I'll be home this afternoon.

495

We'll have bins stationed all around the office for you to put garbage and recycling in.

508
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:55,474
Thanks for taking care of that, Rajeev.

509
00:38:55,938 --> 00:39:02,825
Now, we've hired two new accountants who are supposed to start in a month, and we need to make space for their desks.

510
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:08,390
Now that our work is mostly paperless, the south corner of the office has a lot of empty file cabinets.

511
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:11,333
Number 86.

Hello, and thank you for calling Ziegler Incorporated, the area's top supplier of office paper.

519
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:09,055
Due to bad weather conditions last week, roads around our warehouse were closed.

520
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:14,762
As a result, customers may be experiencing delays in receiving their recent orders.

521
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:18,606
Now that the roads are clear, we've resumed deliveries.

522
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,650
However, we'll need a few days to catch up.

523
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:28,903
To make up for this inconvenience, we're offering customers a 20% discount on their next purchase.

524
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:32,588
To claim the discount, enter your invoice number on our website.

534
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:36,683
The Mayor's decision to redevelop the Hoverton District is welcome news across the community.

535
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:42,610
And for our Commission, it's an opportunity to integrate sculptures into public spaces there.

536
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:49,385
We'll need to determine what overall community themes should be addressed and prioritized.

537
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:54,410
So I think it's important that we conduct a survey regarding the residents' preferences.

538
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:58,815
It's a diverse community with a range of perspectives to consider.

539
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:05,683
And, of course, in order for the artwork to be built, we'll need to hire a skilled artist for the task.

540
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:08,746
I think Alvaro Gomez has won several awards.

541

You're next on the wait list for theatre tickets.

551
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:11,141
On your preference form, you requested four tickets together in either the orchestra or the mid balcony.

552
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:16,228
Unfortunately, those sections are completely sold out on the date you requested.

553
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,754
But I do have four tickets together in the lower balcony for that date.

554
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,809
I'll be happy to set aside those tickets if you'd like.

555
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,671
I can hold this request for 24 hours.

556
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:31,817

Welcome to this bus tour of the Kenzie Harbor.

566
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:35,270
Unfortunately, one of the stops on our itinerary, the museum, is closed, and we won't be able to visit it.

567
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:38,356
The museum had a water pipe burst overnight.

568
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:42,463
It looks like repair and cleanup work will last this whole week.

569
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:44,146
I apologize.

570
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:49,532
since I know many of you were looking forward to seeing the museum's exhibit on local fish.

571
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:59,311
To make up for this, we're providing complimentary meal vouchers so you can enjoy a free lunch on us when we get to the area around the cannery.
