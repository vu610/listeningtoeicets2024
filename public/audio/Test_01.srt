00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:22,835
I agree.

211
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:27,442
The food was great, by the way, especially the peach pie you made.

212
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,445
Would you mind sharing the recipe?

213
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:30,567
It was delicious.

214
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:32,810

216
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,261
There's a really helpful video that walks you through all the steps.

217
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:41,285

228
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:40,802
I'm almost done, but I have a question about a hotel receipt from one of our employees.

229
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:42,124
What's the problem?

230
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:47,369
Well, our policy is for employees to stay at a hotel that's on our list of approved accommodations.

231
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,651
This one isn't on the list.

232
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:50,912
Who submitted the receipt?

233
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,195
Moritz Siekler, one of our sales representatives.

234
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,056
Hmm.

235
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:56,978
He's a new employee.

236
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:59,021
and may have forgotten the policy.

237
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:03,047
As a supervisor, I can approve the expense this one time.

00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:53,076
Hi, Pedro.

248
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:57,061
It was an uneventful night, and our cargo ship still hasn't moved yet.

249
00:16:57,962 --> 00:16:58,142
Hmm.

250
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,106
I hope the fog over the harbor lifts soon.

251
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:02,567
Yeah, me too.

252
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,671
The ship won't be able to leave until the weather improves.

253
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:08,435
I hope we won't get too far behind schedule.

254
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:13,721
I'll be sure to call the Port Authority soon for an update on when we'll be cleared to leave.

255
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:14,822
Sounds good.

00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:04,726
It's under Cohen.

266
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:06,088
Oh, yes.

267
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:07,891
I see your reservation.

268
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,013
Welcome, Ms.

269
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:09,433
Cohen.

270
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:14,722
I know I asked to be seated on your beautiful terrace, but it's very hot today.

271
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:18,549
Hmm, I can seat you at table four inside.

272
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,512
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?

273
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:21,654
Not at all.

274
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,338
By the way, your parking area is nearly full.

275
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,482
Where can I tell my clients to park?

276
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:30,271
Our customers can park for free in the garage across the street.

277
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:33,056
Our cashier will stamp their parking tickets.

278
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,578

291
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,245
I know the store will be busy because we're having a big sale on laptop computers and tablets.

292
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:43,927
We're happy to be here.

293
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:49,413
Our printers are perfect for students or people with home offices who may have limited space.

294
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:52,877
My partner Murat will be setting up the printer station.

295
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:53,938
Yes.

296
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,292
Where can I put our demonstration table?

297
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,974
I'll show you the area.

298
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:04,141

307
00:20:57,634 --> 00:21:01,298
Any thoughts on what we should be concentrating on going forward?

308
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,521
The biggest trend right now is the reduction of sugar.

309
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:08,285
The public wants healthier products, but the same great taste.

310
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,408
That'll be our biggest challenge.

311
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:17,495
One of our ingredients suppliers recently started offering a sweetener made entirely from natural ingredients.

312
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:19,558
Are there similar ones on the market?

313
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:21,039
And how do they compare?

314
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,483
I'd have to do some investigation to find out more about that.

315
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:27,346
I have some time available tomorrow afternoon.

316

324
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,709

325
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:24,511
Thanks for thinking of me.

326
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,733
What type of work would I be doing?

327
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:27,474
Well...

328
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:33,465
We have a new client in Brazil who's interested in creating a marketing campaign for social media sites.

329
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:35,629
You'd be overseeing the campaign.

330
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:38,555
Oh, I have experience with that.

331
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,861
Why don't you send me a detailed description of the work?

332
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:45,508
That'll give me an idea of how much time this project will take.

333
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:51,058
Number 50 Why is the man calling?

334
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:04,634
Number 51 What does the man say a client is interested in doing?

335
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:13,634
Number 52.

336
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,522
What does the woman ask the man to send?

337
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:29,988
Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation.

338
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:31,970
Hey, Koji.

339
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:37,518
We were about to pack van number five for the music festival when we noticed it's got a flat tire.

340
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,280
Oh, that's not good.

341
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,724
We're supposed to get there by 11 to set up lunch for the performers.

342
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:44,807
Is there another van we can take?

343
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,790
Let me see what's available.

344
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,413
We've got a lot of catering jobs today.

345
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,975
Ah, yes.

346
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,138
We can use van number three.

347
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:54,687
Do you need help loading?

348
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:55,949
Yes, thanks.

349
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:01,475
The food's already in coolers, but everything's in the kitchen with the serving utensils and napkins.

350
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:04,258
It all needs to be brought to the parking area.

351
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,260
All right, I can help with that.

352
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:09,144
Number 53.

353
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,467
What problem does the woman mention?

354
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,098
Number 54.

355
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:25,181
Where do the speakers most likely work?

356
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:34,153
Number 55.

357
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,918
What does the man say he will do next?

358
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:50,514
Questions 56 through 58 refer to the following conversation.

359
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:53,019
Thanks for taking my call.

360
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,148
As I mentioned in my email, I'm interested in working in your field, but I'm talking to some professionals first so I can find out more about it.

361
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:02,429
Happy to help.

362
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,571
So how did you get your start?

363
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:11,599
Oh, my family always subscribed to three newspapers, so I always thought the news was important.

364
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,705
At my university, I joined the newspaper and eventually worked my way up to being an editor.

365
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:18,706
Wow.

366
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,295
Is it true that people in the news business work very long hours?

367
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:24,358
So what's your schedule like?

368
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,683
Number 56.

369
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:30,608
Why is the man calling the woman?

370
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,601
Number 57.

371
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,866
Who most likely is the woman?

372
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:51,719
Number 58.

373
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,223
What will the woman most likely do next?

374
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:07,816
Questions 59 through 61 refer to the following conversation.

375
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:09,758
Hi, Karen.

376
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,484
I just read the article on the company website about the proposed merger with QZ Corporation.

377
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,546
It looks like we're going ahead with it.

378
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:20,850
There would be a lot of advantages to merging operations.

379
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,059
Although they also talked about it last year.

380
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:31,593
I remember that, but there were a lot of details to work out, like whether our officers would stay in Chicago.

381
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:34,399
Now it looks like we won't be relocating.

382
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:38,026
Well, I really don't want to move, so that's a relief.

383
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,658
Number 59 What are the speakers mainly discussing?

384
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,704
Number 60.

385
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,048
Why does the woman say?

386
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,734
They also talked about it last year.

387
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,691
Number 61.

388
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:11,218
What does the woman want to avoid?

389
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:24,619
Question 62 through 64 refer to the following conversation and website.

390
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,862
Thanks for calling Customized Concepts.

391
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,023
How can I help you?

392
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:35,129
My company wants to give every employee a gift, something useful but not too big.

393
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:41,355
Since we're about to host our annual staff basketball tournament, I thought a water bottle might be good.

394
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,898
We carry a few drink containers.

395
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,402
If you're at our website, you'll see them under the Lifestyle tab.

396
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,076
Let me pull it up now.

397
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:51,478
All right.

398
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:55,323
I recommend the metal bottle with the wide-mouthed lid.

399
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:58,286
It's easier to clean than the one with the straw.

400
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,908
Okay, thanks.

401
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:03,513
And you could put our company logo on it, right?

402
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:04,174
Yes.

403
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:07,118
You'll just need to send me the graphic file.

404
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:07,859
I can do that.

405
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:10,883
Number 62.

406
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:13,586
Who is a gift for?

407
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:22,455
Number 63.

408
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:25,699
Look at the graphic.

409
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,582
What is the price of the item the man recommends?

410
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:41,597
Number 64.

411
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:45,522
What is the woman going to send to the man?

412
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,072
Go on to the next page.

413
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,546
Question 65 through 67 refer to the following conversation and list.

414
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:13,256
Yun, I just finished recording the audio guide for the pencil drawings that will be included in our modern art exhibit next week.

415
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,660
The files will be loaded onto the audio devices tomorrow.

416
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,762
That's great.

417
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:21,106
But unfortunately, we have to make one change.

418
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:25,006
The drawing by Claudia Hoffman will no longer be in the exhibit.

419
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:30,213
There was a scheduling mix-up, and it was promised to another museum starting next week.

420
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,935
Oh, that's too bad.

421
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:33,897
That was one of my favorite pieces.

422
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,060
Will you put anything in its place?

423
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:37,982
No, we'll just remove it.

424
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,667
Okay, then I'll make that change to the audio guide recording.

425
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,069
I'll do that right away.

426
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:50,418
Number 65 What type of art will be displayed in an exhibit?

427
00:29:58,466 --> 00:29:59,267
Number 66.

428
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,671
Look at the graphic.

429
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,578
Which piece of artwork will no longer be included?

430
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:18,639
Number 67.

431
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:22,706
What does the woman say she will do right away?

432
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:35,539
Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and map.

433
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,083
I'm glad we were assigned to cover the press conference earlier today.

434
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:44,447
I counted seven other major media networks there in addition to ours.

435
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:50,273
Well, the offshore wind industry is going to transform the way this region gets its power.

436
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:51,194
Agreed.

437
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:54,417
Let's compare our facts before we start writing.

438
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:59,602
So the largest cluster of wind turbines off the coast of Winston...

439
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:00,936
is already built.

440
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:07,048
The other sites are at different stages of construction, though Lancaster is also close to being done.

441
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:17,066
Right, and I think it's crucial for us to focus on how many new jobs related to assembling and maintaining the turbines are opening up in the area as a result of this.

442
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,538
Number 68 Who most likely are the speakers?

443
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,344
Number 69.

444
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:34,808
Look at the graphic.

445
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,794
Which site has already been completed?

446
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:51,000
Number 70.

447
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:54,386
What does the man suggest focusing on?

448
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,187
Part 4.

449
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:04,769
Directions.

450
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,856
You will hear some talks given by a single speaker.

451
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:14,865
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speaker says in each talk.

452
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:24,140
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

453
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:30,450
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

454
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:36,503
Question 71 through 73 refer to the following recorded message.

455
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,948
You have reached the information line for the Cranberry Apartments Management Office.

456
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:50,376
On Monday, April 12th, maintenance work will begin to repave the entire parking area adjacent to our building's main entrance.

457
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:57,383
All Cranberry residents should move their vehicles from their designated parking spots before 8am on Monday.

458
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,786
Any vehicles still in its spot after 8 a.m.,

459
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,754
will be towed at the owner's expense.

460
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:10,103
A map of alternate parking sites was mailed to residents last week and is also posted in the building lobby.

461
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:13,048
Number 71.

462
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,072
Who has recorded the message?

463
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:25,165
Number 72.

464
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,530
What are the listeners asked to do?

465
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:37,439
Number 73.

466
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,584
What does the speaker say was mailed last week?

467
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:54,400
Question 74 through 76, refer to the following broadcast.

468
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,744
Welcome to Your House Works.

469
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:04,532
On today's episode, we'll go over how you can maintain and make minor repairs to the roof of your home.

470
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,354
The first thing to do,

471
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:10,883
is to invest in a few special tools like a trowel and crowbar.

472
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:16,390
It's important to choose some that are high quality because you'll use them for many years.

473
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,696
With your trowel and some roof cement, you can seal any cracks or chips.

474
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:26,221
The crowbar will help you remove loose shingles that you can then replace.

475
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:33,810
Now, I highly recommend you take photos of your roof every year so that you can track its overall condition.

476
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,014
Number 74 What is the topic of the episode?

477
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:49,124
Number 75.

478
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:53,348
What does the speaker emphasize about some tools?

479
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:03,058
Number 76.

480
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:06,861
What does the speaker recommend doing every year?

481
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,375
Question 77 through 79 refer to the following talk.

482
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:25,261
Thanks again for joining me on today's tour of the beautiful Wallingford Conservatory.

483
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:30,867
I hope you enjoyed seeing and learning about the many species of plants and flowers we care for here.

484
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,330
As I mentioned at the beginning of the tour,

485
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:40,916
World-renowned botanist Samantha Hughes will be giving a lecture on the care of flowering orchid plants at 2 o'clock in the community room.

486
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:42,638
I recommend attending.

487
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:51,209
Samantha's work has also been featured in a documentary film called Orchid Caretakers, which you can purchase through the Conservatory's online gift shop.

488
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:57,257
I watched it recently and learned many new things about the orchid species we have right here at the Conservatory.

489
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,722
Number 77

490
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:03,377

496
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:46,370
Before the benefit concert begins, I want to thank all of you for supporting the Hillcaster Community Center.

497
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:51,076
As you know, our facilities have been in need of some repairs for quite a while.

498
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:57,804
So far, we've raised $5,000 in ticket sales, but we haven't quite reached our goal yet.

499
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:03,410
So during the concert, I want to encourage you to buy food and drinks from the concession stand.

500
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,558
80% of the proceeds will go to construction at the Hillcaster Community Center.

501
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,020
Enjoy the music.

502
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:12,985
Number 80.

503
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,569
What event is taking place?

504
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:24,484
Number 81.

505
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:28,370

00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,287

510
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,954
Thank you all for attending today's workshop.

511
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:11,168
Arena Kimura and I will be conducting the session, and we'll be focusing on using time efficiently as a business owner.

512
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:16,136
Planning and spending your time wisely is a key factor to business success.

513
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:22,004
During the presentation, I'll be referring to documents from the packet you were handed as you arrived.

514
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:25,590
If you don't have one yet, Irina's at the back of the room.

515
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:30,437
Okay, then, to start off, we'll do an exercise to get to know one another better.

516
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,842
Number 83

517
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:36,536
What is the topic of the workshop?

518
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:45,406
Number 84.

519
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:51,593
What does the speaker imply when he says, arenas at the back of the room?

520
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:00,482
Number 85.

521
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,826

Questions 86 through 88 refer to the following tour information.

523
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:24,784
At this site, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a 5th century marketplace with colorful mosaic tiles on the walls.

524
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:29,208
You'll notice how vibrant the colors are, even after all these centuries.

525
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:32,192
This is what the ruins are most famous for.

526
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:37,337
You can still see intricate details in the artist's pictures of scenes from daily life.

527
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:41,842
Now, to protect the mosaics, a roof has been constructed over the area.

528
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:42,944
and the lights are dim.

529
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:48,252
And I'm sorry, but taking photos is not allowed, as the flash would damage the tiles.

530
00:39:49,073 --> 00:39:52,699
As we proceed, please hold on to the handrails on either side.

531
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,044
They'll help you stay on the path and protect the ruins around us.

532
00:39:58,287 --> 00:39:58,988
Number 86.

533
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,834

534
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:11,739
Number 87.

535
00:40:13,122 --> 00:40:15,145

536
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,180
Number 88.

537
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,986

Questions 89 through 91 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

539
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,488
As you all know, our agencies just won an important contract with Parker Auto Parts Company.

540
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:57,261
We'll be developing two 30-second ads for local radio stations to be released next month and two additional 20-second ads for the following month.

541
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,765
Now, I know it's a tight schedule, but this is a priority.

542
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:04,530
The client has actually started trying to work on this internally.

543
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:07,169
So there's a rough ad we can start editing.

544
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,851
Let's work on that now.

545
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:11,816
Number 89.

546
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:15,261
What is the speaker mainly discussing?

547
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,354
Number 90.

548
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:30,162

00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:57,700
Excuse me, nurses.

553
00:41:58,021 --> 00:41:59,002
Your attention, please?

554
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,849
I've been receiving complaints about the free snacks in the hospital break rooms.

555
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,634
Some people have mentioned that they don't like the selection of snacks.

556
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:13,016
And some have said that they don't get to eat them at all because they're gone by the time the evening shift starts.

557
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:22,766
So I was thinking about putting some money into each of your staff's spending accounts every month so that you can buy the snacks you want at the hospital cafeteria.

558
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:27,151
That will require management approval, but I'll keep you posted.

559
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,094
Number 92.

560
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,778

567
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:27,651
There are a lot of new areas to explore, so we've planned a short hike.

568
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,576
We'll be walking around the pond and along the renovated walking trail.

569
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:35,862
We'll end our walk on the hill on the north side of the park.

570
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:38,546
There we'll be having some free snacks and ice cream.

571
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:43,238
For those of you taking photos, don't forget to post them on the city's website.

572
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,980
We'd like to commemorate this special day.

573
00:43:48,143 --> 00:43:48,843
Number 95.

574
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:53,488

581
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:44,868
Thanks everyone for attending today's free public lecture, sponsored by the Springfield Farmers Association.

582
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,874
So we've received lots of requests for information on growing a vegetable garden.

583
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:54,564
People want to know how to keep their garden healthy and get the vegetables they want.

584
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:58,149
The first thing we recommend is regular soil testing.

585
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:05,900
Since this is September, all soil samples in the next six weeks should be taken from the same depth as seen on this chart.

586
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:12,189
