168
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,390
Why don't we go on our camping trip next weekend?

169
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:28,876
A. Yes, that table lamp is quite nice.

170
00:11:29,997 --> 00:11:30,418
B.

171
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,708
Should we go left or right?

172
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,135
C. I have a performance scheduled with my band.

173
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:43,545
Number 27.

174
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:47,431
The workshop for this afternoon was postponed, wasn't it?

175
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,555
A. At the post office.

176
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,900
B. I haven't checked my email.

177
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,746
C. A ticket for two o'clock, please.

178
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,651
Number 28.

179
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,995
How were our production figures last month?

180
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:11,000
A. They produce electric cars.

181
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:12,302
B.

182
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:14,464
9 o'clock in the morning.

183
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:18,249
C. We were closed down for a week.

184
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,296
Number 29.

185
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,420
When can I see the speech therapist?

186
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,744
A. A one-hour session.

187
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:32,146
B.

188
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:33,867
Just a microphone.

189
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,551
C. How about tomorrow afternoon?

190
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:43,658
Number 30.

191
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,761
Aren't you picking up the clients from the airport?

192
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,305
A. A product demonstration.

193
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,630
B. No, I believe Tomico is doing that.

194
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:58,194
C. He prefers an aisle seat.

195
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:03,995
Number 31.

196
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,899
How is your morning client meeting?

197
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,123
A. It's great to meet you.

198
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,449
B. No, over in conference room two.

199
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,774
C. The contract is now officially signed.

200
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:24,682
Part 3.

201
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,224
Directions.

202
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:30,930
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

203
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:37,286
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

204
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:46,600
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

205
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:52,970
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

206
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:58,738
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

207
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:03,189
The company's making a big change this year by moving offices.

208
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,433
It's exciting that the new space will be much bigger.

209
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:07,254
Yes.

210
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:11,278
Do you know what the company's planning to do with our meeting tables and chairs?

211
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:15,942
Well, the new location already has furniture, so we don't need them.

212
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,804
Why don't we donate them?

213
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:23,269
The Jebrine Foundation is a local organization that picks up old furniture for donation.

214
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,831
That's a good idea.

215
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,794
Let's talk to our directors to see what they think.

216
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:30,635
Number 32.

217
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,200
What change is a company making?

218
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,613
Number 33.

219
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,757
What suggestion does the woman make?

220
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,370
Number 34.

221
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,873
What will the speakers most likely do next?

222
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:13,930
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

223
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:15,532
Welcome.

224
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:19,657
I'm excited to show you both around the Southeast Medical Trade Show.

225
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:23,322
Thanks for allowing us to cover the event for our newspaper.

226
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,706
We really wanted to interview you as the organizer.

227
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:27,326
Yes.

228
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:30,611
How many people are you expecting to attend this trade show?

229
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:34,396
I'm pleased to report that registration has increased this year.

230
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:37,520
We have over 2,000 participants.

231
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,501
That's impressive.

232
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,043
It's our best turnout yet.

233
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:47,532
Actually, before we go into the main room, can we get a photo of you in front of the poster for the show, the one on that wall?

234
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:48,554
Certainly.

235
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:51,578
Number 35.

236
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,962
Who most likely are the women?

237
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,291
Number 36.

238
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:07,835
What does the man say he is pleased about?

239
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,266
Number 37.

240
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,989
What will the women do next?

241
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:32,242
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

242
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,692
Murad, I need your help.

243
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,755
Can you spare 30 minutes?

244
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,799
I have some time after lunch.

245
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:39,760
How can I help?

246
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:46,030
As you know, I've been redesigning Ace Bancorp's website to add new online banking functions.

247
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:50,717
This is the client that wanted streamlined menus on their homepage too, right?

248
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:51,538
Yes.

249
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,324
I wonder whether you could test out the redeveloped site for me.

250
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:56,486
I can do that.

251
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:59,771
Why don't you send me a list of the specific updates you made?

252
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,554
I'll make sure I check those.

253
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,383
Number 38.

254
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,968
What most likely is the woman's job?

255
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,260
Number 39.

256
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:20,385
What will the man most likely do?

257
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:29,477
Number 40.

258
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,362
What will the woman most likely do?

259
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:45,760
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

260
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:53,951
Excuse me, I'm trying to catch a train from this platform, but I've been waiting and no train has arrived.

261
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:54,532
Oh, yes.

262
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:59,979
Unfortunately, some tracks are being repaired, so no trains are departing from this platform.

263
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,001
I see.

264
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:06,588
I had no idea this was happening, and I'm upset that now I'm late for an appointment.

265
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:10,674
Well, they're providing free bus service to the next few stations.

266
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:13,812
You can catch a shuttle bus from the south side of the station.

267
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:16,778
Number 41.

268
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,305
Why is a train platform closed?

269
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:29,202
Number 42.

270
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:33,010
What does the man say he is upset about?

271
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,735
Number 43.

272
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,400
What will the man most likely do next?

273
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,093
Go on to the next page.

274
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,785
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

275
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,509
Thanks for taking my call, Ms.

276
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:08,210
Hazarica.

277
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,966
I understand from your email that you're looking for investors in your business.

278
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:12,626
Yes.

279
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,310
Storing bikes in small apartments is tough.

280
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,133
That's why I've developed this space-saving bicycle rack.

281
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,396
I've seen other indoor bike racks.

282
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:23,057
What's unique about yours?

283
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:27,402
Most indoor racks are one size, but not all bikes are the same.

284
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:31,486
My product can be adjusted to suit different types of bicycles.

285
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,128
That's interesting.

286
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:35,090
Send me your business model.

287
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,298
I need to determine if you have a reasonable plan for expanding production and increasing sales before I make any decisions.

288
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:44,703
Number 44.

289
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,547
Why does the man call the woman?

290
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,940
Number 45.

291
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:01,426
According to the man, what is unique about a product?

292
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,696
Number 46.

293
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,121
Why does the woman request some documents?

294
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:26,899
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

295
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:33,709
Alberto, it's time to leave the studio and head over to the central bank for our interview with the director.

296
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,593
Yes, I have all the cameras we'll need today.

297
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:37,554
Great.

298
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,334
And make sure you have the special low-light lenses.

299
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:43,038
I'm concerned about the poor lighting at the bank.

300
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:47,604
It's pretty dark in there, and that can ruin our key interview shots.

301
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:48,826
Oh, yes, I have those.

302
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,613
And by the way, our new intern Marcel Lambert is interested in joining us.

303
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:54,554
That's a good idea.

304
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,717
It'll be a good experience for him.

305
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,022
Number 47.

306
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,026
What are the speakers preparing for?

307
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:11,855
Number 48.

308
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,859
What is the woman concerned about?

309
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:23,770
Number 49.

310
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,754
Who is Marcel Lambert?

311
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:39,250
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

312
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:46,549
Wasim, I know you've been very busy this morning, but did you have time to take care of the photocopies I asked for?

313
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:47,710
Oh, yes.

314
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,891
Those are all ready.

315
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:49,992
Excellent.

316
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:50,613
Thanks.

317
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:55,398
By the way, how are the preparations coming along for Sabine Hoffman's retirement party?

318
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:56,159
Great.

319
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,983
I've booked a room and invited everyone on our team to the event.

320
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:01,565
I'll call the caterer next.

321
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:09,173
You know, I'm sure she would love to celebrate with her former colleagues from other teams as well if it's not too much trouble to invite them.

322
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:10,034
Sure.

323
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:14,110
I've booked conference room B, but I'll go ahead and change that.

324
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,156
Number 50.

325
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:20,141
What does the woman thank the man for?

326
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:29,119
Number 51.

327
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,626
Why is a gathering being planned?

328
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,455
Number 52.

330
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,394
Hi, I'm Kota Ogawa from Langston Limited.

331
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,108
I have an appointment with Ms.

332
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:11,215
Ishikawa to view your hotel facilities for my company's upcoming retreat.

333
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:16,364
I know that she's been expecting you, and she just wrapped up an urgent phone call.

334
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:17,405
She's on her way now.

335
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:20,290
Hi, you must be Mr. Ogawa.

336
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,053
I'm Hikaru Ishikawa.

337
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,218
Why don't we see our largest conference room first?

338
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:26,000
Great.

339
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,484
And I'd also like to look at the guest rooms.

340
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:31,589
All the rooms have a high-speed internet connection, right?

341
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:32,370
Yes.

342
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:35,678
And we have a fully equipped recreation area as well.

343
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:38,562
Number 53.

344
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:42,248

345
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,221
Number 54.

346
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:53,564
Why was Ms.

347
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,866
Ishikawa delayed?

348
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:03,759
Number 55.

349
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:07,124

Questions 56 through 58 refer to the following conversation.

351
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:22,084
Look at these results.

352
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:25,749
Sales of pineapples have gone up a lot this month at our store.

353
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:29,714
It must be the pineapple peeling machine we installed in the fruit aisle.

354
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,762
Customers like watching it peel and slice their pineapple for them.

355
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:36,405
It is a unique experience.

356
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,309
I think we should install one in our other two store branches.

357
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,011
I'm not sure about that.

358
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:44,195
I think the novelty will wear off in a few weeks.

359
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:49,061
Let's wait to see if sales numbers stay high before we invest in any more.

360
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,004
Number 56.

367
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:40,426
Ingrid, we've had three patients this week who had to cancel their dental appointments at the last minute.

368
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,008
Yes, that's a problem.

369
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:47,335
Other patients might have taken those available appointments if we'd been able to contact them in time.

370
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:49,258
You know, I have an idea.

371
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:58,150
I recently scheduled a doctor's visit online, and there was an option to receive a text message notification if an earlier slot became available.

372
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,573
You just have to check a box.

373
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,275
What do you think about something like that?

374
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,178
That would be helpful.

375
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,133
I have some time this afternoon.

376
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:09,598
I'll look into software packages that include that feature.

378

382
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:42,245

Hi, Raquel.

385
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:02,233
Have you had a chance to look for something I could buy the employees for the new year?

386
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:05,618
I want to be sure I thank everyone for their hard work.

387
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:08,757
Well, a good quality travel mug would be appreciated.

388
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:09,739
Interesting.

389
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,701
Which one would you recommend?

390
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,363
Take a look at this brochure.

391
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:17,708
This company has a variety of designs, sea animals, sky scenes.

392
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,872
I like the medium mug with the desert roaming design.

393
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:22,154
That is nice.

394
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:26,018
I'll sign off on that order request once you fill out the paperwork.

395
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:28,962
Number 62.

396
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,466
Who will the man give some gifts to?

397
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,431
Number 63.

398
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:43,914
Look at the graphic.

399
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:47,038
How much is the mug that the woman likes?

400
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,114
Number 64.

401
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,538

00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:29,474
Great.

407
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:30,595
Let's see.

408
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,979
The actors will be driving north on Maple Street.

409
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,641
Hmm.

410
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:36,402
Is something wrong?

411
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:41,830
We may need to alter the route so it'll be less difficult for our camera operators to follow the action.

412
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,694
Okay, what are you thinking?

413
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:51,023
Instead of turning left on Elm Lane, let's have them turn right and park in front of the hair salon.

414
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:56,571
Okay, I'll arrange for that road to be closed while we're working and alert the business owners.

00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:54,500
I wanted to talk to you about the video game we designed, the one we're launching soon.

425
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:55,482
Sure.

426
00:29:55,802 --> 00:29:56,824
Did something come up?

427
00:29:57,284 --> 00:30:05,898
Well, I think the jungle level looks great, but in the underwater level, there's a problem with the part where the characters discover the lost city in the ocean.

428
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:09,864
As I was going over the layout, I found a glitch in the gameplay.

429
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,186
Oh, okay.

430
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,140
We still have time to fix it.

431
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,464
Yes, but we should work on it as soon as possible.

432
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,268
I could put some extra time in over the weekend.

433
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:20,349
How about you?

434
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,210

00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,655
Studies have shown that plants are great stress relievers and can increase workplace productivity.

481
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:44,680
We think you'll find that this is a great improvement to our work environment.

482
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,565
If you'd like a small plant for your desk, the company will cover the cost.

00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:14,776

Number 79.

490
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,786
According to the speaker, what is available in the staff room?

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,815
Questions 80 through 82 refer to the following broadcast.

492
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:47,583
In local news, the abandoned shoe factory in the Central Business District is finally getting a makeover.

493
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:54,191
The building has been empty for three years since the factory moved to its new larger space south of town.

494
00:35:54,932 --> 00:36:03,442
After hearing many proposals, the town council voted last night to sell the building to developer Matthew Hughes, who will convert it into family housing.

495
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:07,307
10 modern comfortable units with a parking garage underground.

496
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:12,874
Up next, it looks like the rain is on the way out, giving way to blue skies this weekend.

497
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:15,557
Samantha is here to tell us all about it.

498
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,581
Number 80.

499
00:36:19,562 --> 00:36:22,686
According to the speaker, what happened three years ago?

500
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:32,178
Number 81.

501
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:34,444
Who is Matthew Hughes?

502
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:43,376
Number 82.

503
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:47,081
What will the listeners hear about next?

Questions 83 through 85 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

506
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:15,256
Before we end this Transportation Agency meeting, I want to give you an update on the Springdale Bridge Replacement Project.

507
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,958
The project is moving forward.

508
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:24,145
However, we are more than six months past the scheduled completion date, but this is just one of our many projects.

509
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:29,010
Now, this delay is frustrating to residents who are dealing with traffic congestion.

510
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:34,467
Therefore, I strongly recommend that we hold a press conference to address specific concerns.

511
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,392
Number 83.

512
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:40,417
What is the speaker discussing?

513
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:49,773
Number 84.

514
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:55,282
Why does the speaker say, this is just one of our many projects?

515
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,511
Number 85.

516

Attention everyone.

519
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:27,374
I hope you're enjoying the second day of our weekend workshop on leadership skills for entrepreneurs.

520
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:31,858
During yesterday's session, we conducted a discussion about goal setting.

521
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:33,841
And we did that together as a group.

522
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:38,789
However, today I'll be matching you with a partner for a one-on-one discussion.

523
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:46,581
So start thinking about any improvements you'd like to make to your communication skills, because that's what you'll be sharing with each other.

524
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:53,753
And later this afternoon, we'll enjoy a prepared lunch, which has been generously donated to us by Blue Star Catering Company.

525
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:56,056
We're grateful to them for their support.

526
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,602
Number 86.

527
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:04,230
According to the speaker, what will be different about today's session?

528
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:13,220
Number 87.

529
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:16,864
What is the topic of today's session?

530
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:25,914
Number 88.

532
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:42,128
Questions 89 through 91 refer to the following telephone message.

533
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,074
This is Adisa from CarPro returning your call.

534
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:51,061
In your message, you said your sedan seems sluggish and isn't accelerating well.

535
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:56,528
There are a number of things that could be causing that, and prices vary with the repair.

536
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:03,959
It could be as simple as a clogged oil filter, which is inexpensive to fix, but we'll have to take a look.

537
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:06,482
Oh, by the way, we're closing early tomorrow.

538
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,413
But we can get you in the day after.

539
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,995
We'll open at 8 a.m.

540
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:12,979
Number 89.

541
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,665
Where does the speaker most likely work?

542
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:25,758
Number 90.

543
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,026

544
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:39,875
Number 91.

545
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:43,460

546
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:56,498
Questions 92 through 94 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

547
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,148
Thanks everyone for helping set up the showroom floor with the displays of the new bedroom and living room sets.

548
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:05,330
They look great.

549
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:09,760
Many of you have asked for time off next Wednesday to attend the town parade.

550
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:19,036
I wasn't sure I could grant those requests, but after thinking about it, I realized that that day will probably not be a profitable day for us anyway.

551
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,439
I'll post a new employee schedule.

552
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:24,024
Oh, and one more quick announcement.

553
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:27,489
I need all of you to put in an order for a new uniform.

554
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,332
It's time we replace them.

555
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:32,818
Number 92.

556
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,896

557
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:45,871
Number 93.

558
00:41:47,414 --> 00:41:54,226
What does the speaker imply when he says, That day will probably not be a profitable day for us anyway.

00:42:04,498 --> 00:42:07,202
What does the speaker expect the listeners to do?

561
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:20,725
Questions 95 through 97 refer to the following telephone message and map.

562
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:25,012
Hi, this is Emily calling from Speedy Services.

563
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:28,498
I'm picking you up from the central train station today.

564
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:34,814
I see you selected a pickup location near the ticket windows, but there's heavy traffic on that street.

565
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:41,102
Would it be possible to change your pickup location to right outside the station's Grand Concourse?

566
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:43,946
It's the designated area for rideshare services.

567
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,573
Please let me know if you agree with this change by responding to the prompt within the app.

568
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:49,954
Thanks.

569
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:52,937
Number 95.

570
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,402
Who most likely is the speaker?

571
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,243
Number 96.

572
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:07,707
Look at the graphic.

573
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:10,351
Where does the speaker want to meet?

574
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:23,412
Number 97.

575
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,898
How can a change be confirmed?

576
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:40,381
Questions 98 through 100 refer to the following speech and conference schedule.

577
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:42,123
Good morning.

578
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:46,629
My presentation will look closely at the nutritional benefits of eating fruit.

579
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:54,139
Patients often wonder whether the amount of sugar in fruit makes fruit unhealthy, and some even consider limiting it in their diet.

580
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,201
But it's more nuanced than that.

581
00:43:56,902 --> 00:44:03,090
Last year, I published a paper reporting on my research on eating the current recommended serving of fruit each day,

582
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:05,841
versus eating less of it for weight loss purposes.

583
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:12,150
I'll spend the next 45 minutes going through the results, and then it'll be time for the coffee break.

584
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:19,841
During the coffee break, feel free to wander to the dining room, where our sponsor has set up a booth to sample a new nutritional beverage.

585
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:22,825
Number 98.

586
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:25,648
Look at the graphic.

587
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:26,770
Who is the speaker?

588
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,652
Number 99.

589
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:42,979
What did the speaker do last year?

590
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:52,400
Number 100.

591
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:57,010
According to the speaker, where can the listeners test a product?
