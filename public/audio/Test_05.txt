176
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:00,028
Why haven't the windows been replaced yet?

177
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,490
A.

178
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,636
Not too much wind, no.

179
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,002
B. Look in the filing cabinet.

180
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,728

Number 28.

182
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:20,764

00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:32,517
I'll have to pay a little bit extra.

187
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:38,427
Number 29.

188
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:42,393
Who manufactures the engines for our machines?

189
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:48,262
A. Koji is in charge of supplier contracts.

190
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,045

00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:51,688
The storage room is full.

192
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,474

Number 30.

194
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:06,198

Directions.

206
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:50,747
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

207
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:57,394
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

208
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:06,502
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C or D on your answer sheet.

209
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:12,910
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

210
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:18,558
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,741
Hi, Shenzhou.

212
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:27,090
I'm practicing my presentation in the conference room across the hall and the projector in there keeps shutting off.

213
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:28,816
I think it's overheating.

214
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:30,519
Has this happened to you?

215
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,942
Oh, that projector is old.

216
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,985
It really needs to be replaced.

217
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:39,312
If I were you, I'd just move to room 204 and practice there.

218
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,415
Also, that room has a window.

219
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,757
It's much nicer.

220
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,260
Okay, thanks.

221
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:49,347
By the way, you'll need a special cable to connect to the control panel in that room.

222
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:50,910
Here, you can use this one.

223
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,033
Just leave it plugged in when you're finished.

224
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,498
Number 32.

225
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,497
What problem does the woman describe?

226
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:08,933
Number 33.

227
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,957
What does the man suggest doing?

228
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:21,473
Number 34.

229
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,818
What does the man hand to the woman?

230
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,456
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation.

231
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:43,084
Hi, I'm Amanda Hoffman, and I'm on the panel of publishing experts.

232
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,509
I was told to check in here at the registration desk.

233
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,551
Yes, Ms.

234
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,011
Hoffman.

235
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,615
Welcome to the Portland Literary Conference.

236
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:55,222
Here's your registration packet, which includes a gift card to thank you for participating.

237
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:56,363
Oh, thank you.

238
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:01,170
Just to confirm, the panel discussion begins at 3 p.m., right?

239
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:06,051
Yes, but we do ask that all panel members arrive ten minutes beforehand.

240
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:07,912
I hope you enjoy the conference.

241
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,396
Number 35.

242
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,919

Number 36.

244
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,394
According to the man, what is included in the registration packet?

245
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,652
Number 37.

246
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,895
What does the man tell the woman to do?

247
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:54,090
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

248
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:58,796
I'm looking for a gift for my brother's birthday party this weekend.

249
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:02,340
He loves teas and you have so many varieties.

250
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,026
Well, I could recommend a quality brand if you know what type he enjoys.

251
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,672
Oh, I'm not sure.

252
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,414
Hmm.

253
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:13,537
Maybe I should get him a gift card so he can choose his own.

254
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,179
That's a good idea.

255
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,841
I'll get one for $50.

256
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,885
Do your cards have an expiration date?

257
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:26,152
Yes, we ask that they be used within one year of purchase.

258
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:27,234
Number 38.

259
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,898
What event will the woman attend this weekend?

260
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:39,739
Number 39.

261
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,105

262
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:52,201
Number 40.

263
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,186

264
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:08,830
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

265
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:11,554
Thanks for meeting with us, Ms.

266
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:11,795
Raj.

267
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:16,381
We're excited to learn about the product your company has developed for factories like ours.

268
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:18,525
I'm happy to tell you about it.

269
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:22,110
It's an application to monitor factory machines.

270
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:28,499
It identifies problems in operations and generates a report about the efficiency of each machine.

271
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,322
That sounds great.

272
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:33,438
We have about 100 machine operators here.

273
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,322
How much training would be involved?

274
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:37,624
About an hour's worth.

275
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:41,249
We provide a video with step-by-step instructions.

276
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,411
Excellent.

277
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:43,212
That's good to know.

278
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,056
Number 41.

279
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,940
Why is the woman visiting?

280
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:58,354
Number 42.

281
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,252
What did the woman's company design?

282
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:10,142
Number 43.

283
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:14,187
What does the woman say her company can provide?

284
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,018
Go on to the next page.

285
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:33,551
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

286
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,135
Hi, I'd like to go to the Baldwin Theater.

287
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,899
The address is 91 Circle Drive.

288
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,823
Sure, but did you know they're resurfacing Circle Drive?

289
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,146
I just dropped someone off in that area.

290
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:47,367
Oh, really?

291
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,511
I've got a ticket to a play, and the show starts at 7.30.

292
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:52,894
They don't let you in if you're late.

293
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:54,555
Well, let me see.

294
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,818
I can turn on to Felton Street.

295
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,098
and cut over to Lancaster Drive.

296
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,564
It's a little out of the way, but it'll get you close to the theater.

297
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:05,450
Number 44.

298
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,656
Who most likely is the man?

299
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:18,113
Number 45.

300
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,658
What is causing a problem?

301
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,531
Number 46.

302
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,876
What does the man say he will do?

303
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:45,676
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

304
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:50,584
Do you have a minute to discuss the budget for the upcoming Vancouver meeting?

305
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,989
I've looked over the travel request you submitted for your team.

306
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,234
Last year we sent only two representatives.

307
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,030
Ms.

308
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,754
Tamura has just given us approval to send three.

309
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:08,926
In fact, the clients are looking to expand their online service options, and the third representative we're bringing is particularly knowledgeable about that.

310
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,691
Okay, I guess we'll have to find savings somewhere else then.

311
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,776
I've already looked into some new meeting venues.

312
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,601
The Renova Hotel is offering discounted corporate rates this month.

313
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:22,526
Number 47.

314
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:25,650
Why does the woman say...

315
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,653
Last year we sent only two representatives.

316
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:37,605
Number 48.

317
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:42,211
According to the man, what do some clients want to do?

318
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:51,203
Number 49.

319
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,746
According to the man,

320
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,793
What is the Renova Hotel offering this month?

321
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:09,247
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

322
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,029
Good morning.

323
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,215
I wanted to meet today to discuss the recent decline in our museum's ticket sales.

324
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,738
You're the outreach coordinator.

325
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:24,681
So I'm hoping you might have some ideas on how we can attract more community involvement.

326
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:31,209
Well, I recently read an article about a museum in Chicago that has a room where visitors can paint on the walls.

327
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,271
It's become very popular.

328
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,733
We could try it here.

329
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,378
We have that huge room on the third floor that isn't being used.

330
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,320
That's a great idea.

331
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:45,406
Can you draft a list of the supplies we would need to make sure we have the budget for them?

332
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:48,530
Number 50.

333
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,368
What problem does the woman mention?

334
00:22:51,408 --> 00:23:00,377
Number 51.

335
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,721
What does the man suggest doing?

336
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:12,770
Number 52.

337
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:16,594

Questions 53 through 55 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

339
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,785
Tilo, this is Ms.

340
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,106
Gow a new customer.

341
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,289
She's purchasing an upholstered sofa.

342
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,575
We just walked around our showroom, and she's decided on our Hudson model.

343
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,437
One of our best sellers.

344
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:44,320
It is really comfortable.

345
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,384
Can you assist her with the paperwork for our payment plan?

346
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:48,185
Sure.

347
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,607
Happy to help you, Ms.

348
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:49,947
Gow.

349
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,050
Are you getting the standard fabric?

350
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:55,259
No, I'd like to select a custom fabric.

351
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,186
Just so you know, the price will increase some with a custom order.

352
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:01,390
I think it's worth the extra cost.

353
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,714
It'll really brighten up my living room.

354
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:04,896
Wonderful.

355
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:09,544
Now, in order to set up a payment plan, I'll need to see some identification.

356
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,367
A driver's license will do.

357
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:14,352
Number 53.

358
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,938
Where most likely are the speakers?

359
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,104
Number 54.

360
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:31,411
According to the man, why will a product cost more?

361
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:40,425
Number 55.

362
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,570

Good morning, Mr. Tong.

365
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,210
I'm here to check on my order.

366
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,413
How are the chairs coming along?

367
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:04,696
The machines have been assembling them.

368
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:05,937
They're almost ready.

369
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:06,939
Right over here.

370
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,422
Wow, they look so nice.

371
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:11,926
Look at the curved shape of the back.

372
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:17,173
The only way you can get that unique shape is by means of the specialized laser we use.

373
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:18,494
Amazing.

374
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:21,138
Can I also see the pull-out sofa?

375
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:24,522
Not right now, it's being treated with mineral oil.

376
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:28,268
But later today I should be able to take a photo and send it to you.

377
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:31,152
Number 56.

378
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,617

Hi, Sojin.

385
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:16,913
I just heard that Ms.

386
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,435
Yun is retiring next month.

387
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,537
I'll be sorry to see her go.

388
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:26,162
She was my mentor when I first joined the firm, and we've worked on dozens of projects together.

389
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,110
It's a bit hard to imagine our sales team without her.

390
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:32,857
Has anybody approached you about leading the team after she's gone?

391
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,161
Yes, and I've thought about it.

392
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,989
It's a big step up, even for someone like me who's worked in sales for eight years.

393
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,015
And Human Resources hasn't even posted the job description yet.

394
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,920
Well, we need someone with experience.

395
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:49,905
Number 59.

396
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,850

Number 60.

398
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:04,867

Rajesh, it was nice to see you here in New York again this year.

403
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:39,936
Same here.

404
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:44,122
I look forward to attending the theater technology conference again next year.

405
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:49,610
I really enjoyed your talk, especially the information you provided on acoustics.

406
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,192
Is it published anywhere?

407
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:53,015
I'd like to have a closer look.

408
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,898
Actually, it is.

409
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:58,787
You can find the article in last November's issue of Theater Sound.

410
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,329
It's posted online.

411
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,130
Great.

412
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,112
I'll look it up.

413
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:05,116
Oh, my train leaves in 14 minutes.

414
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,358
I have to get going.

415
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:07,860
Safe travels, Camille.

416
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,824
Number 62.

417
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,109
Why are the speakers in New York?

418
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,602
Number 63.

419
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:26,706
What does the woman ask the man about?

420
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:35,723
Number 64.

421
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,168
Look at the graphic.

422
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,234

00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:54,740

Welcome to Orlando's Deli.

426
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:12,465
If you'd like to try one of our daily specials, they're on the board behind me.

427
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,648
Wow, that's a great menu.

428
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:16,610
The vegetable curry looks good.

429
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:17,772
Is it spicy?

430
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:22,258
No, it's very mild, but we just sold out, unfortunately.

431
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:24,645
In that case, I'll have the lasagna.

432
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:26,327
Great choice.

433
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:31,133
By the way, we just opened our new patio this week in case you'd like to sit outside.

434
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:35,418

444
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:36,569
Which trail should we hike?

445
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:37,831
Let's take a look at the map.

446
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:42,297
We're at the visitor center, and there's a shuttle that stops at different trailheads.

447
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,199
Right.

448
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,605
It looks like the Creek Trail and the Pond Trail are fairly short.

449
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:50,549
I'd like to do a more challenging hike.

450
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:50,930
Okay.

451
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:52,484
How about the waterfall trail?

452
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:53,846
That sounds good.

453
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,811
And look, there's a video about the park.

454

I'm calling from Springdale Light.

471
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:27,553
Yesterday, you ordered 24 of our purple solar lanterns for your upcoming event.

472
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:35,726
Unfortunately, our supplier won't be able to get us purple lanterns for another three weeks, so we only have yellow ones in stock.

473
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:40,212
We would like to offer you a 10% discount on them to apologize for this.

474
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:45,901
Please call us back to confirm whether you'd like the yellow solar lights, and we'll set them aside for you.

The former owner, Ms.

484
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:36,636
Youping Way, was a famous painter.

485
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:39,359
What's special about this estate is that Ms.

486
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,462
Wei designed it herself, including the landscaping.

487
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:50,610

00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:53,814
