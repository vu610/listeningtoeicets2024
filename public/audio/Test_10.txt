00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,287
Why isn't Ms.

169
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,508
Perez here yet?

170
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:26,712
A. No, I can't hear anything.

171
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,055
B. Company headquarters.

172
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:34,039
C. Because she's meeting with her manager.

173
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:40,085
Number 26.

174
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:44,469
I heard that our company might be merging with another one.

175
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,233
A. Oh, I didn't know that.

176
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:49,714
B.

177
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,631
A good selling product.

178
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,216

179

Number 27.

180
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,666
Could you ask the next patient to come in?

00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:07,910

182
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:11,194
B. The waiting room is empty.

183

A. I'll try the strawberry flavor.

187
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:31,793
B. We have a view of the beach.

188
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,417

Number 29.

190
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,986
How long will it take us to get to the theater?

191
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,330
A. Tickets for the performance are sold out.

192
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:52,697
B. At 7 o'clock, I think.

193
00:12:53,778 --> 00:13:02,048
C. Actually, I don't have a preference.

194
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:02,929
Number 30.

195
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,394
Are you going to send a report or give a presentation to our clients?

196
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,898
A. We enjoyed their talk.

197
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,382
B. I'll probably do both.

198
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:15,744

00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,906

Number 31.

00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:32,359
A. Sure, my car will be fixed soon.

203
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,825

204
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:40,129

Part 3.

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,600
Directions.

You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

208
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:58,662
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

209
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:07,974
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

210
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:14,342
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

211
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:19,990
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

212
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,994
Welcome to the Firelamp Bistro.

213
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,135
How many for dinner?

214
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:28,521
There'll be five of us, but I'm afraid I forgot to make a reservation.

215
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:29,883
No problem.

216
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:35,010
But I should mention that we'll be closing earlier than usual this evening for a private event.

217
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:41,759
If you'd like to sit outdoors on the patio while you wait, I'll send a server to get you started with drinks and appetizers.

218
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,062
We'll get you seated as soon as possible.

219
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,205
That sounds fine, thank you.

220
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,591
And if possible, we'd like to sit in a quieter part of the restaurant.

221
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:52,754
We have some business to discuss.

222
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,531
Number 32.

223
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,756

Number 33.

225
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,753

227
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,890

Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

229
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:39,736
Hi, Suresh.

230
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:43,962
Office World Incorporated is thrilled about this collaboration with your company.

231
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:49,048
Your signature line of office products looks great, and we believe they'll sell quite well.

232
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,531
We're looking forward to partnering with you.

233
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,352
Thanks.

234
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,296
I look forward to a good working partnership as well.

235
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:59,762
And I'm proud of the fact that all my products are made with recycled materials.

236
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,606
I want to promote environmental responsibility.

237
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:03,828
I'm impressed.

238
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,114
Ah, and here is Vodika with our camera equipment.

239
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:10,460
Hello, I'm here to take some promotional photos.

240
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,247
I'd like to get some shots of you with your products, Suresh.

241
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,010
We want to post them online.

242
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:19,476
Number 35.

243
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,962
What is the conversation mainly about?

244
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:31,767
Number 36.

245
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:36,052
What does the man emphasize about some products?

246
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:45,443
Number 37.

247
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,607
Why has Vedica joined the meeting?

248
00:16:56,837 --> 00:17:00,882
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

249
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,297
Highly wrong, thanks for meeting with me.

250
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:11,186
I'd like to consider advertising strategies for our bicycle shop during the annual charity bicycle race.

251
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:17,815
Well, like last year, as one of the sponsors of the event, we'll have our company name printed on the banner.

252
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:27,648
Great, but this year, I'd also like us to donate our top-of-the-line bicycle to the winner of the race to show how much we care about our community.

253
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,330
That's a nice idea.

254
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:32,166
But sponsoring the race is already going to be costly.

255
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:36,132
I'm worried about the added expense of donating a bicycle as well.

256
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:39,417
Number 38.

257
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,402

Number 39.

259
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,282

00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:04,175
Number 40.

261
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,280
What concern does the woman express?

262
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:19,800
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation.

263
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:24,067
Welcome, Farida, and here's your identification badge.

264
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,231
My name's Malik Al-Jahani.

265
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:30,738
I'm a senior engineer, and during your first 60 days at Tilmer Tech,

266
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:34,490
I'll be mentoring you throughout the new employee onboarding process.

267
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,252
I'm glad to be here.

268
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:41,659
Your company's one of the top manufacturers of robotic vacuum cleaners in the country.

269
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,608
Since I just graduated from university, it's exciting to be applying all that theory directly to this engineering job.

270
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:50,950
Absolutely.

271
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:54,514
And right now, we're headed to your first activity for today.

272
00:18:55,235 --> 00:19:00,882
Like all new engineers here, you'll be tasked with taking apart and reassembling our top-selling product.

273
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:05,793
It's a first step in helping you become knowledgeable about how our product functions.

274
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:08,718
Number 41.

275
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,961
Who is the man?

276
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:19,996
Number 42.

277
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,922
What product does the company manufacture?

278
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,711
Number 43.

279
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,274
What will the woman most likely do next?

280
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:45,944
Go on to the next page.

281
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,634
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

282
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,218
Hey, Joty, I can't believe it.

283
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:05,381
You know how I told you that I won some tickets to my favorite basketball team's championship for this weekend?

284
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:07,403
Well, now I can't go.

285
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:08,564
Why?

286
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,605
What happened?

287
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,508
You look really disappointed.

288
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:14,871
One of my clients has requested a rush on their order.

289
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:19,617
I'll need to do a quality check on all the products so we can ship by Monday morning.

290
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:22,160
Well, I'm free this weekend.

291
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,122
Why don't I take over for you?

292
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:27,826
Just let your supervisor know that I can do the quality check.

293
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:29,700
You can help me out next weekend.

294
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:33,004
Number 44.

295
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,549
What was the man hoping to do this weekend?

296
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,961
Number 45.

297
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:49,586
Why does the man need to cancel his plans?

298
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,331
Number 46.

299
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:01,416

Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

301
00:21:14,254 --> 00:21:20,703
I understand that you found a good candidate to deliver the keynote speech at our conference.

302
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:21,424
I have.

303
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:22,846
Dr. Murad Jabrine.

304
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,330
He's a specialist in sports medicine.

305
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:29,352
and he's developed new surgical techniques for athletes with knee injuries.

306
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:33,419
His new book on the topic will be published later this month, actually.

307
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,803
Oh, yes, I've heard of him.

308
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:40,510
I wonder if we have enough money to give copies to everyone who comes to the conference.

309
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,113
I can check our budget.

310
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:45,358
Number 47.

311
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,226
What was the man asked to do in preparation for a conference?

312
00:21:58,274 --> 00:21:59,035
Number 48.

313
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:02,280
Who is the conference intended for?

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:11,254
Number 49.

315
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:16,242

Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

317
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,949
Hi, I'm calling about your advertisement.

318
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:39,840
I currently rent a space downtown where I build and repair furniture, but the owners just sold the building and I have to be out by the end of the month.

319
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:46,429
Well, my space is quite large, enough to fit two cars or a work truck.

320
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:51,216
It also has a dock in the back to load large containers, if that would be useful to you.

321
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:52,818
Ideally, yes.

322
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:57,420
I build large items and a loading dock would make pickup and delivery easier.

323
00:22:57,981 --> 00:22:59,683
Would you like to see it this afternoon?

324
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:04,369
Currently there's no electricity, but I could call and have it turned on today.

325
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:07,494
Number 50.

326
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,276

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,347
Masim, I know this is last minute, but is there any chance we can add another section to the workbook for tomorrow's seminar?

333
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,730
Oh, the workbook's already been printed.

334
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:00,615
I see.

335
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:06,747
I just learned that the company added a new policy about working with clients that we need to include.

336
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:12,898
Well, why don't we just add an insert to each copy of the workbook before we pass them out?

337
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,543
Then everyone will be informed of the change.

Number 53.

339

Hi, Astrid.

Thank you for meeting with me.

347
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:06,813
Of course.

348
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:10,657
I have an open-door policy for all my employees here at the factory.

349
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:14,923
So I'd like to talk about changing my work schedule to the day shift.

350
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,968
Well, we've had a lot of requests for that lately.

351
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:19,789
I see.

352
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,294
But remember, I've been working the night shift for over 10 years.

353
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:25,836
That's true.

354
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:27,538
Let me look into it.

355
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:29,930
I'll check the schedule and see what I can do.

356
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:31,493
No promises, though.

357
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:34,378
Number 56.

358
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,643

Number 57.

360

I have bad news.

365
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,340
Ifay just sent me a text message.

366
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:24,943
Her car won't start.

367
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:26,765
The battery seems to be dead.

368
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:29,810
She won't be here in time to lead her tour group.

369
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:30,663
Oh no.

370
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,826
Well, I'm leading a tour of the seaport this morning.

371
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,108
Rajiv, you're available.

372
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,872
I know you're technically still in training, but I think you can handle it.

373
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:41,313
Hmm.

374
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,636
The historic warehouse district, right?

375
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,718
I'm a little nervous about that.

376
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:49,481
You did a great job when you shadowed me on that tour last week.

377
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:54,006
You even answered questions from the group.

378
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:54,727
Number 59.

379
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,970

Number 61.

383
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:20,612

Question 62 through 64 refer to the following conversation and road lane diagram.

385
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:40,039
We need to check with the project manager about today's construction schedule.

386
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,400
I already did.

387
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:43,183
I just came from his office.

388
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:47,788
He said we're going to close off multiple lanes to create a safe work zone.

389
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:48,609
Got it.

390
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,111
Which ones are we closing?

391
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:52,674
All of them, except for the passing lane.

392
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:53,655
Wow.

393
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:57,120
This closure is really going to affect the morning commute.

394
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,941
You're right.

395
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:02,146
I'm going to ask for extra personnel to help manage the traffic volume.

396
00:28:04,368 --> 00:28:05,650
Number 62.

397
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,405

Number 63.

399

Number 64.

402
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,332

405
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:04,057
Let's start planning the annual employee retreat.

406
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:05,138
Yes.

407
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:07,004
I think we should hold it outside.

408
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:12,712
We're at our desks all day, so it would be really great to spend some time in the sun.

409
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:13,754
I agree.

410
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:18,080
There's a place Oliver's Orchard that lets you pick your own fruit.

411
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,742
We could have the event there.

412
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:21,004
Great idea.

413
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:22,687
The retreat's in June.

414
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:24,028
Is it open then?

415
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:26,091
According to the website they are.

416
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,113
Perfect.

417
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:30,117
I'll call the Orchard to make a reservation for our group.

418
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,682
Number 65.

419

Which fruit will be picked during the event?

423
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:05,303
Number 67.

424
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,628

00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:21,688
Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and map.

426
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,135
Hi, I'm looking for an apartment, and I saw your advertisement.

427
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:29,900
Do you have any two-bedroom apartments available in May?

428
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:30,942
Yes.

429
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:31,122
Yes.

430
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:35,030
In fact, we've just finished construction on a new complex.

431
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:38,054
Does the complex have a lot of outdoor space?

432
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:41,578
I'd like to have an area to entertain guests outside.

433
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:44,461
Yes, there's plenty of green space.

434
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:50,688
The building in the back corner, farthest from the office, has the most space and a lot of shade.

435
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,670
I'd be interested in that.

436
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:59,698
And for an extra $80 per month, you can get a reserved parking space right in front of your unit.

437
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,548
Number 68.

438

447
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:06,603
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

448
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:12,810
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

449
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:19,217
Question 71 through 73 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.

450
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:27,986
Some of you have been accidentally skipping some of your closing duties, so I've called this meeting to clarify what is expected.

451
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:36,257
After you've sanitized all the food preparation areas in the kitchen, make sure the pantry and walk-in refrigerator doors are shut and locked.

452
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:39,764
There are a few other tasks to complete before you leave.

453
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:45,154
I know the current checklist isn't up to date, so I'll make the necessary revisions to it.

454
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:51,346
Number 71 What is the purpose of a meeting?

461
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:44,121
I just read your article about protecting old growth forests in Europe and how important these conservation efforts are to the local communities.

462
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:48,688
First of all, I loved your descriptions of the mushroom hunting social groups.

463
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,152
Readers will feel like they're there.

464
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,274
However,

465
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:56,959
Your article mainly presents the views of people who use the forests for recreation.

466
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,685
We need to hear from the lawmakers responsible for the new regulations impacting land use.

467
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:05,068
And be sure to include some photos.

468
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,591
Aside from that, great job.

00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:09,528

479
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,175
To start things off, we're delighted to invite Dr. Haruka Adachi to the stage.

480
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:20,722
She'll demonstrate some ways computer systems can simulate human intelligence.

481
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:26,802
Even if you're not a computer programmer, I'm sure you'll find this demonstration easy to follow.

482
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:31,510
Please feel free to raise your hand to ask questions at any time.

483
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,394
We want these sessions to be interactive.

00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:37,839

They also mentioned that they'd like to make some adjustments to the project timeline.

Hi, everyone.

522
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,245
As farm employees, we have all come across various issues with our equipment.

523
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:24,274
Today, I'm going to talk about what to do when you find liquid leaking from any of our farm equipment.

524
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:30,627
Our mowers and tractors mainly use fluids like water or oil to control steering.

525
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:36,956
When you find fluid leaking from a broken tube or valve, don't try to fix it yourself.

526
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:42,524
Please let me know, and I'll contact the manufacturer for a replacement part.

527
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,148
Otherwise, the warranty will be voided.

This chart shows the clinic's average monthly expenses.

550
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:59,314
Our wages for dental hygienists, assistants, and other staff members are about 25% of the budget, which is right on target.

551
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:05,919
Even though our rent has gradually increased over the years, it still doesn't take up a large part of our budget.

552
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,204
However, look at the costs of our supplies.

553
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:13,430
You know, we haven't looked at other suppliers recently.

554
00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:19,058
Any savings we might find could be used for marketing to help bring in more business.

555
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,724

563
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,734
Hi, I'm calling to purchase some backpacks for my company.

564
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:22,562
We recently started selling textbooks, and our employees will be traveling regionally to sell them.

565
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:32,134
I'd like to provide the backpacks to our customers as promotional gifts, but I'd like them to be sturdy, so I'd like something with padded straps to make them comfortable.

566
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:35,538
And there should be easy access to a water bottle as well.

567
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:38,989
If you have what we need, we plan to order 50 of these.

568
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,692
So can you tell me if there is a bulk discount?

Hi, everyone.

579
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:43,852
As most of you know, I opened this grocery store five years ago.

580
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:51,304
I'm happy that we are the main supplier of fruits and vegetables in the neighborhood, and the demand for our products has increased.

581
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:56,672
To meet this need, we've received a loan that will allow us to expand our operations.

582
00:44:57,353 --> 00:45:00,658
These additional funds will allow us to make an important change.

583
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,834
Effective immediately, we'll be open seven days a week.

584
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,776
That means we'll have extra shifts available.

585
00:45:08,317 --> 00:45:11,640
