00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:13,070
A. Yes, I worked on those.

168
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,594
B. It wasn't as long as we thought.

169
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:20,198
C. People like watching videos.

170
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:26,244
Number 26.

171
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:30,909
The party is supposed to start at 6pm, right?

172
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,210
A.

173
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,944
I added her name to the guest list.

174
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:39,388
B. No, the invitation said seven.

175
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:43,872
C. Because the party decorations were expensive.

176
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:50,378
Number 27.

177
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,943
Does the manager want us to pick up the supplies or have them delivered?

178
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:58,086
A. She'll be here soon.

179
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,309
B. You dropped your pen.

180
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,770
C.

181
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,416
You're right about that.

182
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:10,465
Number 28.

183
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:14,111
Has Jacob come into the office today?

184
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,897
A. His briefcase is on his desk.

185
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:22,464
B. Yes, it is a nice office.

186
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,988
C. I can come in for just a minute.

187
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,538
Number 29.

188
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:34,821
Are you joining the team for today's briefing?

189
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:38,827
A. My top client is in town.

190
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,312
B. Vitorio's Pizzeria.

191
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,816
C. I enjoyed that film.

192
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:51,965
Number 30.

193
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:56,171
I'm organizing a healthy eating program at the office.

194
00:12:57,412 --> 00:13:00,276
A. She studied at that theater program.

195
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:01,618
B.

196
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,853
Right beside the new projector.

197
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,218
C. Do you need any help with it?

198
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,208
Number 31.

199
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:17,155
Is your car expensive to repair?

200
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,841
A. The largest model available.

201
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,166
B. Only a few more times.

202
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,754
C. It's been running perfectly since I bought it.

203
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:34,415
Part 3.

204
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:35,737
Directions.

205
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:40,223
You will hear some conversations between two or more people.

206
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:46,732
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speakers say in each conversation.

207
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:56,045
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

208
00:13:56,766 --> 00:14:02,514
The conversations will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

209
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:08,041
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following conversation.

210
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,687
Mr. Hughes, my name is Ms.

211
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:12,248
Ihan.

212
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:16,995
I'll be interviewing you today for the open position of patient transporter.

213
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,902
I see on your application that you've worked in health care before.

214
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:22,003
That's right.

215
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:28,754
I worked at the main reception desk at the Southeast Regional Hospital for a while, but I'd like to try a different role.

216
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:34,550
You'd be responsible for moving patients to various locations throughout the hospital.

217
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:38,675
It'll involve about six miles of walking every shift.

218
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,197
Are you okay with that?

219
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:48,008
I actually do a lot of hiking and rock climbing in my free time, so I'm looking forward to having a job that'll have me on my feet more.

220
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:50,993
Number 32.

221
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,898
Where is the conversation taking place?

222
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:03,663
Number 33.

223
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,129
What was the man's previous job?

224
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,623
Number 34.

225
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,170
What does the woman emphasize about the job being offered?

226
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:35,034
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

227
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:40,221
Hello, I'm calling to discuss the men's suit and coat store that you want to open.

228
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,344
Thanks for returning our call.

229
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,607
My cousin and I are both on the line.

230
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,909
Yes, thanks.

231
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:49,874
At first, we were just going to open the business without any advertising.

232
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:53,699
Right, but then we consulted a friend in the retail industry.

233
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,706
He said a strong advertising campaign makes a difference and referred us to you.

234
00:15:58,978 --> 00:15:59,799
He's right.

235
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,705
You need to advertise your store before it opens.

236
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,109
Have you looked at the information we sent?

237
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,193
Yes, and here's what I think.

238
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:11,581
First, you should emphasize the fact that this will be a family-run business.

239
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,165
Local customers will appreciate that.

240
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,672
Number 35.

241
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,138
What kind of business will the men open?

242
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:30,448
Number 36.

243
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:34,634
How did the men learn about the woman's consulting service?

244
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:44,047
Number 37.

245
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,754
What does the woman say should be emphasized about a business?

246
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,792
Questions 38 through 40 refer to the following conversation.

247
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:03,175
Look what just arrived.

248
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,320
They're the new handheld scanners we've been waiting for.

249
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,802
That's exciting.

250
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:11,287
It's going to be so much easier to scan the groceries with these.

251
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,853
Do you know when they'll be installed at each of the checkout stations?

252
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:19,359
Our manager is hoping to set them up tomorrow night after the store closes.

253
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,105
She asked if I could help, but I'm not available.

254
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,108
Oh, I can stay late tomorrow night.

255
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,610
I'll go let her know.

256
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,491
Number 38.

257
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,735
What are the speakers excited about?

258
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,105
Number 39.

259
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,329
Where most likely do the speakers work?

260
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:54,299
Number 40.

261
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,362
What will the woman tell her manager?

262
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:11,015
Questions 41 through 43 refer to the following conversation with three speakers.

263
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm Mona Palavi from Palavi Construction, and this is Ms.

264
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,122
Taylor, our interior designer.

265
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,205
We're looking for a source for reclaimed lumber.

266
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:26,530
Many customers are asking to incorporate old wood into their construction projects.

267
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,592
You've come to the right place.

268
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:34,418
We carry wood rescued from barns, factories, and other structures that have been torn down.

269
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:37,497
People think using reclaimed lumber is cost effective.

270
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,619
Is that true?

271
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,541
Surprisingly no.

272
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:46,769
It's actually more expensive because we have to go through a lengthy process to make the wood reusable.

273
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,251
Hmm.

274
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,772
What do you think about that, Ms.

275
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:50,193
Taylor?

276
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:57,242
Customers will pay more for the old wood look, but I'm sure they'd like to see some samples before deciding.

277
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,165
Number 41.

278
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,050
What type of business do the women work at?

279
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:12,859
Number 42.

280
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:17,827
According to the man, what may be surprising about a product?

281
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,740
Number 43.

282
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:28,783
What will Ms.

283
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:31,387
Taylor most likely ask the man for?

284
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,362
Go on to the next page.

285
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,875
Questions 44 through 46 refer to the following conversation.

286
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,660
Thanks for agreeing to give me a tour of your company, Ms.

287
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,060
Varma.

288
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:59,445
It'll provide plenty of information to use in my article for the newspaper.

289
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:00,446
No problem.

290
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:04,271
Did you say you write a series about local businesses?

291
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,997
Yes, I do a weekly column spotlighting the histories of unique companies in our region.

292
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:12,981
Now, I read that your father founded the company.

293
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,002
That's right.

294
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,725
He started it with only 10 employees.

295
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:20,870
It seems like it's expanded a lot since then, right?

296
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,894
We export to 59 countries around the world.

297
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,036
Impressive.

298
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,218
Let me show you the shipping area.

299
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:30,482
Number 44.

300
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:33,246
Who most likely is the man?

301
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:42,898
Number 45.

302
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,515
What does the man say he read about the company?

303
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:55,550
Number 46.

304
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:02,322
Why does the woman say, We export to 59 countries around the world.

305
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:14,865
Questions 47 through 49 refer to the following conversation.

306
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,868
Hi, Sergei.

307
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,494
Have you been able to finish the updates for the new bridge we're designing?

308
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,299
I'd like to include them in the agenda for our client meeting next week.

309
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,449
Yes, I've reinforced some structural features and added the pedestrian walkway they asked for.

310
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,831
Oh, perfect.

311
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:36,137
Could you take over that part of the meeting to explain the changes to the clients?

312
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:37,620
Sure, I can do that.

313
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,122
But first...

314
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,162
I'll send you the updated calculations on the bridge's weight capacity.

315
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:48,087
Some of the numbers have changed significantly because of the structural changes we've made.

316
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,190
Okay, I'll take a look tomorrow and get back to you.

317
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:53,993
Number 47.

318
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,276
Who most likely are the speakers?

319
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,706
Number 48.

320
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,669
What does the woman ask the man to do?

321
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:18,720
Number 49.

322
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,724
What will the man send the woman?

323
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:34,180
Questions 50 through 52 refer to the following conversation.

324
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:35,922
Katon.

325
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,465
think about this month's marketing report.

326
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,091
It looks like our computer keyboard sales are decreasing.

327
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:43,954
Yes, I saw that.

328
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:47,700
I think it may be connected to our existing marketing strategies.

329
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:51,166
The keyboards are advertised mostly on our website.

330
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:56,454
I think we need to look into expanding our advertising campaign to other types of media.

331
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:57,917
That's a good idea.

332
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,302
Perhaps we need to advocate for a larger marketing budget.

333
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,826
That would provide us with more options.

334
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,594
Let's bring this up at our next marketing meeting.

335
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:09,658
Number 50.

336
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,923

Number 51.

338
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,666

Hi, Raoul.

343
00:23:55,375 --> 00:24:02,305
I wanted to let you know that we received all of the bids we were waiting on for the Meyerville Bridge Replacement Project.

344
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:03,147
Thanks.

345
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,490
Are there any acceptable bids?

346
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,478
I'm worried that with costs rising nowadays, we may exceed our budget for city infrastructure projects.

347
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:17,205
Well, steel costs per ton are in the thousands for every bid.

348
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:18,287
I see.

349
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:24,875
We've already reached out to all of the contractors we can, so we'll just need to seek additional funding then.

350
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,801
Let's put together a spreadsheet comparing the bids this afternoon.

351
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,786
We'll use that for reference at our next Transportation Department meeting.

Number 55.

357
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:10,456

359

00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,360
I just got back from that industry trade show in Vancouver.

361
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,144
Thanks for recommending the Arch Coast Hotel.

362
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:32,946
I thought you'd like it.

363
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,993
I know how important conservation is to you.

364
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:41,579
Did you know that it was the first environmentally sustainable hotel in Canada?

365
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,762
Yes, I spoke with the owner.

366
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:47,506
He described the hotel's history and told me about their plans.

367
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:51,991
They'll be closed next month while they work on an addition to the main building.

368
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:54,934
Number 56.

369
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,258

00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:07,067

I hope you didn't have too much trouble finding our banking office.

377
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,348
Please take a seat.

378
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:49,216
I've read your application, and it looks like we'll be able to finance your business project.

379
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,078
Oh, that's wonderful news.

380
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,383
Opening a flower shop has been my dream for so long.

381
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:55,485
Absolutely.

382
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,808
I just have one detail to confirm.

383
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:00,873
Do you still live at 21 Anderson Avenue?

384
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,076
Actually, I've recently moved.

385
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,999
Here's a card with my new address.

386
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,101
Thanks.

387
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:06,962
I'll be right back.

388
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:11,325
I need to go over to the printer to pick up some documents that I need you to sign.

389
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:14,230
Number 59.

390
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,355
What did the woman apply for?

391
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:26,470
Number 60.

392
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,058

00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:01,710
How may I help you?

398
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:08,018
I have a two-person cabin booked for next Monday night, but I'm hoping to change my reservation.

399
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,365
Okay, to a different day?

400
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:14,791
No, we still want to stay on Monday night, but we'd like a bigger cabin.

401
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:16,773
What size do you need?

402
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:19,457
One that accommodates three or more people.

403
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,922
Well, there's only one larger cabin available.

404
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:24,664
It costs $150.

405
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,547
That's fine.

406
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:27,348
We'll take it.

407
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,233
Also, do you offer private tours of the nature preserve?

408
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:32,114
We do.

409
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:35,058
It's complementary with your cabin booking.

410
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:39,527
Just let me know when you'd like to do it and I'll make arrangements with our guide.

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:42,550
Number 62.

Please.

422
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:47,492
One of the tractors just broke down out in the cornfield, and Kyle sent me back for a toolbox.

423
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:52,297
I just started working here, though, so I'm still getting used to the layout of this place.

424
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, you'll want to go to the tool shed.

425
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,583
It's right across the road, next to the pond.

426
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,664
All right.

427
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:00,406
Which way is that?

428
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:02,709
Actually, I'll head over there with you.

429
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,431

A client just called.

439
00:30:57,787 --> 00:31:02,291
I need to check on a large batch of tablecloths, napkins, and linens that we're cleaning.

440
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:03,993
What's the job number?

441
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:05,955
Um, 17.

442
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:09,760
They requested that everything be ready tonight instead of tomorrow.

443
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,562
Let's make this a priority.

444
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:12,543
Okay.

445
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:16,267
I see their initial order came in at 11.30 this morning.

446
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:19,250
Their items haven't been placed in the washer yet.

447
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:21,416
When do they need this rush work done?

448
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:22,877
By 5pm.

449
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:26,281
We can do it if we put them ahead of job 16.

450
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:27,603
Sounds good.

451
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:30,105
So I'll just hold 16 back then.

452
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:33,269
That will help free up some washing machines and dryers.

453
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,332
Number 68.

454

You will hear some talks given by a single speaker.

463
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:32,204
You will be asked to answer three questions about what the speaker says in each talk.

464
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:41,295
Select the best response to each question and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet.

465
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:47,442
The talks will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

466

During our going out of business sale, all of our hardcover books are being deeply discounted.

00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:08,732
From now until the end of the week, they will be sold at an 80% discount.

470
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:13,277
In addition, all paperbacks will be 50% off this week.

480
00:34:10,776 --> 00:34:17,923
Before we wrap up this meeting, I wanted to discuss the picnic our department has been planning for next Saturday.

481
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:20,946
I've already purchased most of the decorations.

482
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,393
And Lorenzo has volunteered to bring a cake.

483
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:28,458
Actually, Lorenzo, there's a great bakery not far from the park that you could order from.

484
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,962
It's cash only, but there's a bank across the street.

485
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:34,685
We still need other food and supplies, though.

486
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:40,551
I've posted a list of what we still need in the break room, so write your name next to the item you'll bring.

A technician is coming in an hour or two.

512
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,467
I know the sales reports are due on Wednesday, but I've talked to your team leads about the issue.

Sorry, I know some of you will find this regulation inconvenient.

554
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:14,514
As a reminder...

555
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,004

It doesn't make financial sense for our kitchen to stay open late.

570
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:32,208
This is a seasonal adjustment that we make every year.
